Abstract
Here, we study the temperature structure of flaring and non-flaring coronal loops, using extracted
loops from images taken in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels recorded by Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA)/ Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). We use data for loops of X2.1-class-flaring active
region (AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, September 6; and non-flaring active region
(AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, October 26. By using spatially-synthesized
Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we calculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops.
We apply the Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature series of each
strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the flaring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4
min. These temperature oscillations show very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe
that the temperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10 minutes before the
transverse oscillations and continue for a long time duration even after the transverse oscillations are
ended. The temperature amplitudes are increased at the flaring time (during 20 min) in the flaring loops.
The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring loops are ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min,but
their significances are less (below 0.5) in comparison with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the
detected temperature periods for the non-flaring loops’ strips are less probable in comparison with the
flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations. Based on our confined observations, it seems that the
flaring loops’ periods show more diversity and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than the
non-flaring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect requires more extensive statistical research
and broader observations.
Coronal Loops,Temperature Analysis, Temperature Oscillations,Flaring and non-Flaring Active Regions

I. Introduction
Analyzing the thermal structure of coronal loops is of considerable interest, especially as these
magnetic loops have an essential role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona. Such analysis can help to describe how the process of solar flaring is correlated with the loop’s thermal
structure.
Detections of coronal waves have a historical preview and have been reported for several times
(e.g., Aschwanden et al. (1999); Nakariakov et al. (1999);Wang et al. (2003); Wang & Solanki (2004);
Berghmans & Clette (1999); De Moortel et al. (2000), Verwichte et al. (2004), De Moortel & Brady
(2007), Ballai et al. (2011)). Coronal seismology and MHD waves have been reviewed widely by
1

De Moortel (2005), Nakariakov & Verwichte (2005), Aschwanden (2006), Banerjee et al. (2007) and
De Moortel & Nakariakov (2012). Along with the development of the observations, transverse
and longitudinal oscillations have also been studied theoretically (e.g., Gruszecki et al. (2006),
Pascoe et al. (2007), Fathalian et al. (2010); Luna et al. (2010); Fathalian & Safari (2010). Coronal
seismology techniques help to elicit the information from observations of oscillatory phenomena
and the results to be interpreted by using theoretical models (see for e.g., Roberts et al. (1984);
Goossens et al. (1992)). Oscillatory patterns and processes which happen during solar flares, were
interesting and subject of investigations from different approaches (e.g., Nakariakov et al. (2010),
Nisticò et al. (2013), Anfinogentov et al. (2013), Hindman & Jain (2014), Russell et al. (2015)). As
we know the transverse loops oscillations usually occur in response to a close filament or flare
(Wills-Davey & Thompson (1999)).
Rapidly decaying long-period oscillations are mostly interpreted as global (or fundamental mode) standing slow magnetoacoustic waves (reviewed by Liu & Ofman (2014), and Wang
(2011), also see Ofman & Wang (2002), and for slow-mode observed in fan-loops see Pant et al.
(2017)). They often occur in hot coronal loops of active regions, associated with tiny (or micro-)
flares.Increasing evidence has suggested that the harmonic type of decaying pulsations detected
in intensity plots of solar and stellar flares are possibly caused by standing slow-mode waves (see
reviews by Van Doorsselaere et al. (2016), and McLaughlin et al. (2018)).Excitation, propagation,
and damping mechanisms of slow-mode waves have been studied theoretically (e.g., Wang et al.
(2007); Wang et al. (2015); Jess et al. (2016); Nakariakov et al. (2017); Nisticò et al. (2017); Kolotkov
et al. (2019); Krishna Prasad et al. (2019); Reale et al. (2019); Wang & Ofman (2019)). To have
a complete overview of slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops see the review by
Wang et al. (2021).
Investigating and comparing the thermal structures and oscillations of coronal loops in loops
of flaring and non-flaring active regions could help us in better understanding the loops’ material
oscillations and the flare impact on them. Several different methods have been developed to investigate the thermal structure of the coronal loops and loop strands. The thermal stability of the
coronal loops was the subject of research, done by Habbal & Rosner (1979) (and references cited
therein). McClymont & Craig (1985) stated that a pressure fluctuation must assist asymmetric
coronal temperature perturbation. They concluded that coronal loops are impartially stable in
the case of uniform heating. Van Doorsselaere et al. (2011) used spectroscopic line ratios to obtain
the required temperature (via CHIANTI code) and estimated the adiabatic index of the corona.
The dependence of coronal loop temperature on loop length and magnetic field strength is also
a favorite topic. For instance, Dahlburg et al. (2018) probed the temperature properties of solar
coronal loops over a wide range of lengths and magnetic field strengths via numerical simulations and observed a very high correlation between magnetic field strength and a maximum of
the temperature. The effect of temperature inhomogeneity on the periods and the damping times
of the standing slow-modes in stratified solar coronal loops was studied either (e.g., Abedini et al.
(2012)). Fathalian (2019) estimated the loop temperature using the intensity ratios and the AIA response functions in different wavelengths. Different emission measure (DEM) computations and
methods have been developed to estimate the temperature in the corona, which led to various
discussions. Schmelz et al. (2010) analyzed a coronal loop, which was observed on 2010 August
3, by AIA. They took some differential emission measure (DEM) curves, claiming a multithermal
rather than an isothermal DEM distribution (for the cross-sectional temperature of the loop). After that, Aschwanden & Boerner (2011) criticized the method of background subtraction which
Schmelz et al. had applied. They claimed that the background subtraction method caused their
inferred result of a multithermal loop. Aschwanden & Boerner (2011) analyzed a set of hundred
loops and understood that 66% of the loops could be fitted with a narrowband single-Gaussian

DEM model. In this regard, some attention was paid to the instrumental limitations and ability of AIA and Guennou et al. (2012a,b) discussed on the accuracy of the differential emission
measure diagnostics of solar plasmas in respect of the AIA instrument of SDO. The abovementioned controversy of whether the cross-field temperatures of coronal loops are multithermal or
isothermal, continued by Schmelz et al. (2013) (similar to Schmelz et al. (2011)). They analyzed
twelve loops to understand the cross-field temperature distributions of them and reveal the loops’
substructure. Based on their achievements, the warmer loops entail broader DEMs. Thereafter,
Schmelz et al. (2014) found indications of a relationship between the DEM weighted-temperature
and the cross-field DEM width for coronal loops. They argued that cooler loops tend to have
narrower DEM widths. This could imply that fewer strands are seen emitting in the later cooling phase, which they claim could potentially resolve the abovementioned controversy. In this
subject, Aschwanden et al. (2015) (as well as 2013 (Aschwanden, 2013)) developed a method to
extract the loop temperature which is based on Gaussian fit for Differential Emission Measure,
named spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method (DEM hereafter).
This paper aims to analyze and compare thermal oscillations of coronal loops in flaring and
non-flaring active regions, 11283 and 12194, respectively. The contents of this paper are as follows:
In section II, data, we introduce the considered flaring and non-flaring active regions and describe
the data employed and the time and properties of the flare, occurred in the active region. In
section III, we explain the method we use to analyze the time-series of temperatures in different
strips of the loops. Section IV is specified to our results, obtained related to flaring and nonflaring regions. In section V we briefly state a summary of this work.

II. Data
We investigate the thermal structure and treatment of loops in a flaring region to see if it follows
the transverse oscillations of the loops, and we examine the thermal fluctuations at the flare time.
For this purpose, we select a high energy flare x2.1 which the transverse oscillations of two loops
of it have been analyzed by Jain et al. (2015). They analyzed intensity variations in the wavelength
171 in two coronal loops of this region and detected obvious transverse oscillation with periods
of roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes for these loops at the flare time. To see
the specific thermal properties of the flaring loops, as a blind test, we select a non-flaring active
region, extract its loops and analyze their thermal treatment. Then we compare the temperature
treatment of the loops at the flaring region with the loops of the non-flaring region to see the
differences.
The temperature analysis done here uses EUV images from the AIA onboard the SDO. AIA
has ten different wavelength channels, three in white light and UV, and the other seven in EUV
channels. Between these seven, the 304 filter, which is mostly sensitive to chromospheric temperatures (in order of T = 104.7 K), not the corona, is not taken into account (Aschwanden et al. 2015).
Therefore, we consider the images of the events in the six wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335
). These are covering the coronal temperature range from T ≈ 0.6 to T ≥ 16MK.
The two below data sets are finally selected to study thermal variations and coronal loops
oscillations in flaring or non-flaring active regions. A few distinct loops are visible in the regions.
Finally, these loops are chosen:
– Three loops of the x-flaring active region 11283: Observationally, the X-class flares are rarely
happening around the loops with the specification we are looking for. So this selected LOS
X-flare, which occurs near the loops is of rare cases. We consider EUV images of NOAA
AR 11283, in the time period of 22:10UT till 23:00UT of 2011 September 6 with the cadence

of 12 sec. This period of time is selected since no other flare is happening during it. A
few distinct loops are visible and follow-able here during this period. Loop shapes in our
active region change permanently; therefore, it is difficult or impossible to follow a loop
over a very long time. Hence, it is not useful to extend the time interval of this region
to the time before the flare. The transverse oscillations of two loops in this region were
analyzed before by Jain et al. (2015). We mark these loops by A and B in Figure 1 b. They
detected fundamental mode oscillation with periods of roughly 2 minutes and decay time
of 5 minutes for these loops. We are curious to see the loops’ thermal oscillations (if any)
or thermal fluctuations in this condition. Figure 1a (left) displays AR 11283 and the area,
indicated by the white box is featured in a zoom-in view in Figure 1.b (right) and the five
selected parts of the center of the three chosen loops are shown by red lines (the movie of
the region is available in this link). As it is clear in the movie, these three loops oscillate
together and their oscillations decay simultaneously. The center of figure 1.a is coordinated
′′
′′
at (230, 165) arcsec and its width and height are 450 × 456 /750 × 775 pixels. The flare
occurring in this active region is an X2.1 class flare located close to the disk center at latitude
14◦ north and longitude 18◦ west (269.9 arcsec, 129.9 arcsec). This flare initiates at 22:12UT,
ends about 22:24UT with the peak at 22:20UT, and associates with a coronal mass ejection
(CME) which occurs from 2011 September 6, 21:36:05T to 2011 September 7, 02:24:05T, with
the radial velocity of 469 km/s,angular width of 252 deg, and position angle of 275 deg (for
more details look at LASCO CME catalogue.) 1
– Three loops of non-flaring active region 12194: As a blind test, we select three loops of the
non-flaring (nonf hereafter) active region 12194 in the smooth time period of 08:00:00UT till
09:00:00UT of 2014 October 26. The center of figure 2.a is coordinated at (0, -264) arcsec
′′
′′
and its width and height are 615 × 615 /1025 × 1025 pixels. We consider the images of
the selected area with the cadence of 12 sec in the same six wavelengths mentioned above.
These loops are relatively motionless and do not show any transversal oscillation (see the
region’s movie in the link). We select the loops in such a way that they do not have any
crossing over the neighbor loops (in our perspective) during this time. In figure 2 the
selected loops are distinguished in red in the mentioned active region. The size of the final
cut of non-flaring region (represented in the right) is 351 × 401 pixels.
The data set are primarily downloaded at level 1 with a pixel resolution of 0.6 arcsec. We use
the standard aia_prep.pro subroutine available in SDO package SolarSoftWare library to adjust
the screen scale between the four arms of the AIA. This pre-processing step increases the data
level from 1 to 1.5, so that finally no jump or sudden movement is observed in the image series.
We also used drot_map.pro subroutine to correct the differential rotation effect. According to the
movie made by pre-processed images, the most obvious loops (marked in the abovementioned
figures) are selected in each region (with obvious transversal oscillations in the case of the flaring
active region).

III. Temperature Analysis Method
We extract the selected loop segment pixels, for each loop, and calculate the normal vectors
to each point of the loop’s direction. Then by using these data, we straighten each loop in a
considered box with the thickness of 15 to 40 pixels (macro-pixels, depending on the available
empty area around each loop and the distance to the neighbor loop). The area around the
loop is needed for calculations of background subtraction. The selected loop segment is cut in
1 Based

on data on these WebSites: https://solarflare.njit.edu/webapp.html, and https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/

all wavelengths and at the same considered box from the images set. These loop images are
necessary entrances for our thermal analysis process. Then the loop is divided into different
strips and its best division in terms of pixel intervals is considered. To do thermal analysis, we
use the spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method founded by Aschwanden
et al. (2015).
The images in the above six wavelength filters are considered to calculate the temperature in
each strip of the loop. The DEM function is considered a single-Gaussian function relative to the
temperature determined by the forward fitting method. To obtain the temperature for each loop,
we divided the loop into narrow strips, and then the intensity flux was averaged over each strip.
The number of each strip is displayed with the index i. One of the usual methods to subtract
the background from observed data is fitting a single-Gaussian cospatial function with a linear
function on the flux profile. The DEM for each strip is considered to be single-Gaussian DEM
in terms of the logarithm of the temperature, which has three free parameters (Aschwanden &
Boerner, 2011):

DEMi =

[log ( T ) − log ( Tp,i )
dEMi
= EM p,i exp (−
).
2
dT
2σT,i

(1)

In which, Tp,i is the DEM peak temperature, EM p,i is the peak EM function, and σT,i is the
logarithmic width of the temperature for that strip. To calculate the background-subtracted fluxes
(for each strip) we use Eq.6 of Aschwanden & Boerner (2011) (in below):
F0λ =

Z

dEM ( T )
Rλ ( T )dT = ∑ EM ( Tk ) Rλ ( Tk ).
dT
k

(2)

Here, Rλ ( T ) is the instrumental temperature response function of each wavelength filter λ, which
is obtained by the code aia_get_response.pro in the SSW package. As time has passed, the AIA
response functions calibration has partly changed. Here, we use the updated calibration of the
temperature response functions, for each of the AIA temperature filters, according to the CHIANTI Version 2019 code available in the Solar SoftWare (SSW). After forward-fitting the Gaussian
DEM to the background-subtracted observed fluxes in multiple wavelengths, the three-fitting parameters, temperature width (σT,i ), peak of temperature (Tp,i ), and peak emission measure (EM p,i )
are found by minimizing χ2i .
Our data sample is uneven because of omitting some damaged images in between. Therefore to analyze the temperature oscillations, we use the Lomb-Scargle method. This method is
developed to use the technique periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced (Scargle, 1982). The Lomb-Scargle periodogram method is useful in cases where
the periodicity of data treatment is not immediately apparent. This method allows efficient computation of a Fourier-like power spectrum estimator from unevenly-sampled data, resulting in
an intuitive means of determining the period of oscillation (VanderPlas, 2018). Therefore we use
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram to evaluate and estimate the efficient periods of temperature oscillations in our loops. We select the first period related to the highest power frequency, which is
obtained by this method.We considered the achieved periods with the highest significances and
amplitudes. The most significant (highest) periods observed in temperature (minute) for flaring
and non-flaring loops are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. To estimate the significance of
the periods, we computed the probability values (p-values). In the Lomb-Scargle method, the
significance returned here is the false alarm probability of the null hypothesis, i.e., as the data
is composed of independent Gaussian random variables. Accordingly, low probability values
(p-value less than 0.05) indicate a high degree of significance in the associated periodic signal.

Temperature Analysis of Flaring Active Region Loops

Thenceforth the temperature time-series of different strips of the selected loops are calculated
using the method described in section 3. In the following figures, the vertical axis shows the
logarithm of the temperature and the horizontal axis shows the time duration. To be comparable
by eyes, all the forthcoming figures (which show the loops temperature oscillations) have been coscaled in the (log) temperature range of 5.7 to 6.9. The color maps are shown for each temperature
map. Loops A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 are subdivided into 25, 11, 8, 12, and 6 strips, respectively. Each
strip’s length is equal to 4 pixels (macro-pixel), for all loops in this paper. For brevity, a few strips’
temperature oscillations are presented here. Figure 3 displays the time-series of temperature
oscillations for the first 3 strips of Loop A, and first 2 strips of loops B1. We calculated the
errors for each point (temperature) but removed in the presentation to avoid overcrowding of the
figures. As we observe in Figures 3 and 4), the temperature oscillations are started and increase
around 22:12 before the flare peak time (22:20) and are mostly continuing after the flare ended
(22:24). These temperature oscillations follow the transverse loop oscillations observed by Jain
et al. (2015). As Jain et al. reported, LoopA and B have a transverse oscillation with periods
of roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes, starting at 22:18 around the flare peak time
(23:20) and decaying after the flare ended (22:24). So as we observe, the temperature oscillations in
these flaring loops happen before the start of their transverse oscillations and are continuing even
in the time interval after the transverse oscillations decay. Although the temperature oscillations
do not decay as rapid as the transverse oscillations do, and conversely, the loop temperature
increases at the end of the oscillating mode (see Fig.4, the temperature map of the loop A, for
instance)
We calculate the temperature oscillations periods, using Lomb-Scargle method. We consider
the thermal oscillations periods with the highest significances. As this method shows, the most
powerful period in the range of data time-series (listed in Table1) are from 7 to 28.4 minutes
observed in the strips of the marked loops of this flaring region. These loops of flaring region
also show some short periods in temperature oscillations which some are less than 10 minutes
(listed in Table1). These short periods are more frequently observed in the loops of the flaring
active region. Such short periods are very scarce for the loops of the non-flaring active region
(compare Tables1 and 2).
The first column in Table1 is the number of every strip along the loop. The second column is
the period of the most powerful frequency observed for the loop strips, calculated by the LombScargle method. The third column shows the maximum of log( T ) minus its minimum in each
strip. The columns of Table2 are exactly the same as Table1; the only difference is that Table2 is
for the non-flaring loops.
The loop A, has the length of 42.3 (Mm) which is the length of the selected part of the loop
marked in Figure 1.b. The mean of the parameter (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) for the strips of loop A
is 1.21. Mean of the temperature (log) of this loop over time is 6.15 ± 0.25. The loop B1, divided
into 11 strips, has the length of 20.24 (Mm). The mean of (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) and the mean
of the temperature for this loop are, 1.10, and 6.28 ± 0.22 respectively. The loop B2, which has 8
strips, with the length of 15.61 (Mm), has the mean temperature (log) of 6.21 ± 0.21. The mean
of (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) is 0.81 through this loop segment. The loops C1 and C2, divided into
12, and 6 strips, have the lengths of 22.08 and 11.06 (Mm), the mean temperatures of 6.25 ± 0.22,
and 6.14 ± 0.25 (log), and the mean (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) of 1.48, 0.88, respectively.
We observe that despite the temperature oscillations, the flaring loops show a temperature

rise at the end of the considered time interval (figure3). As their temperature maps also show,
the oscillations follow with a relatively sensible rise in the final temperature of the loop segments
(Figures 4). Although in the case of the transverse oscillations, the loops oscillate as the flare
occurs and then the oscillations decay and stop, in the case of temperature oscillations, the temperatures of the various strips of the loops oscillate and at the end of the flare occurrence, they
get to a relatively higher value of temperature in average.
Figure 4 shows the temperature maps of the flaring loops A, B1, B2, C1, and C2, respectively
as a time series. In each plot, the vertical axis is the distance along the loop segment in Mm, and
the horizontal axis shows time. The color bar (in the left) shows the temperature range. Each
separated grid part on the map is standing for one strip. Figure 4 shows that the temperature
for most of the strips increased, bypassing a few oscillations. Before the end of the time duration,
some strips become hotter (yellow ones) and some cooler (blue ones). The loop B1 is colder at
the early times of the duration and becomes hotter at the middle and end times with a swing
to lower temperatures again (see Fig. 4). There are some temperature fluctuations at the middle
times (the red and green stripes) while at the end the strips temperatures are smoother with less
fluctuations. The temperature map of the loop segment B2 (Fig.4) shows that at the beginning of
the time duration, the first strips of the loop are hotter, and the last ones are colder, but at the end
times this pattern is reversed in this loop segment. In loop segment C1 (Fig.4), the temperature
fluctuations are mainly observed to start after the end of the flare (22:24), and at the end time
(23:00) the temperature is much higher than the beginning. The temperature is increasing after
the flare time (22:24) for the loop C2 either (see Fig.4). This happens with some oscillations in
the strips’ temperatures. So as figure 4 shows, the temperature increases with some fluctuation
in most of the flaring loops’ strips after the flare time. According to these temperature maps,
the temperature fluctuations in the flaring loops are increasing at the flaring time and around 20
minutes after that.
We expect the flaring loops to cool down as a result of heat conduction and radiative cooling.
Hence this relative temperature increase should be scrutinized. As we probed, this temperature
rise is also followed in intensity time-series. As the intensity time-series show, the related intensity
in the Loop A of the flaring AR increases at the end of the time duration. To be assured, the
authors also checked the wavelength of Fe XV I I I which has a peak formation temperature of
7 × 106 ◦ K (Ugarte-Urra & Warren (2014)). By using the method developed by Warren et al. (2012)
the contribution of the Fe XV I I I emission line can be isolated from the AIA 94 , to analyze the
evolution of hot plasma in the loops. We do it to omit the contamination from the cooler plasma
(mostly around 1MK) which also contributes to this AIA channel Boerner et al. (2012). This is
done by subtracting the contaminating warm (i.e., around 1MK) component to the bandpass.
This warm contribution is calculated from a weighted combination of the emission from the AIA
171 and 193 channels dominated by Fe X and Fe XI I emission, respectively. This intensity
analysis is done directly and it has not gone through any other process like the thermal analysis.
For this purpose, we applied the formulation (1) used by Li et al. (2015). Plots in Figure 5 show
the intensity map, and the mean intensity variation of the wavelength Fe XV I I I, for Loop A of
the flaring region, respectively. As these plots show, this intensity is also higher at the end of
the time duration in respect of the flare time. It seems to us that the expected cooling has not
occurred in these flaring loops yet, even after the flare occurrence in the probed duration due to
some plausible reasons. We consider that the mentioned simultaneous CME (see sectionII) which
this flare is associated with could cause this increase in temperature. We can be sure that the
source of this CME is AR 11283 (Romano et al. (2015)). This CME is in our flare region, hence
the loops receive energy even after the flare occurrence and it is probably the reason why the
expected cooling does not occur.

The thermal oscillations periods obtained the Lomb-Scargle method, do not have the same
significance in all strips of the loops, but for most strips of the flaring loops, the significances are
very near to one. To be assured about these oscillations, we probed the intensity time-series for
each strip of the loops and we observed that this loop’s intensities shows intensity oscillations
too (i.e., alongside the loop). The most probable dominant periods observed in intensity, for
wavelength of 171 is 18.22, and 16.7 min for strips of F-Loop A, 16.7, and 18.22 min for strips of
F-Loop B1, 16.70, and 12.52 for F-Loop B2, and 16.7 for F-Loop C1 and F-Loop C2. These periods
are in the same order of the observed thermal oscillation periods. The intensity in this time series
has not passed any thermal process but still shows oscillation periods close to thermal ones. So
we think these results confirm the observation of thermal oscillations.

Temperature Analysis of non-Flaring Active Region Loops

The temperature time-series for different strips of the selected loops of the non-flaring active
region 12194 are calculated using the Lomb-Scargle method. In the following figures (Fig. 6),
the vertical axis shows the logarithm of the temperature and the horizontal axis shows the time
duration. Figure 6 displays the time-series of temperature variations for the first two strips of
the non-flaring Loops A, and B. These figures are all co-scaled in the range of 5.7 to 6.9 for the
logarithm of temperature (like the flaring loops range). The most powerful periods, observed in
most of these non-flaring loops’ strips (listed in Table2) are from 8.5 min. to 30 min. Comparing
the periods of the loops in the flaring region (Table1) with the non-flaring one (Table2), we see
that the temperature periods of the flaring loops have lower values on average and have more
diversity than the non-flaring ones. As Tables 1 and 2 show, the mean temperatures of nonfloops are lower in comparison with the f-loops, a fact we also expected from common sense.
The parameter (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) in nonf-loops’ strips is less than that for the flaring loops’
strips.
Nonf-loop A, divided into 11 strips, has the length of 19.91 (Mm) which is the length of the
selected part of the loop marked in Figure 2b. The mean of (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) for the strips
of nonf-loop A is 0.81. Mean of the temperature (log) of this loop segment over time is 5.93 ± 0.10.
Nonf-Loop B, divided into 6 strips, has the length of 11.11 (Mm), and the mean temperature (log),
and the mean of (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) for this loop are, 5.99 ± 0.13 and 0.62 respectively. Nonfloop C, which has 5 strips, with the length of 10.13 (Mm), has the mean temperature (log) of
5.82 ± 0.12, and the mean (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) of 0.56.
The first highest period observed for the temperature oscillations of these non-flaring loops’
strips is reported in Table2. As we observe the temperature periods in these non-flaring loops
are mostly longer than those of the flaring loops (compare the values listed in Table1 and Table2).
Therefore the temperature oscillations of these loops are a little slower than the flaring ones.
Figure 7 shows the temperature maps of the non-flaring loops A, B, and C, respectively as a
time series. In each plot, the vertical axis is the distance along the loop in Mm, and the horizontal
axis is the time. The color bar in the left shows the colors considered for the temperature range.
Each separated colored part in the map is one strip. These color maps are plotted totally at the
same color range of the loops of the flaring region either.
As figure 7 shows, the strips’ temperature of these non-flaring loops have fewer temperature
fluctuations and are smoother in comparison with the flaring ones (Fig. 4). Furthermore, that
much increase in the temperatures of the strips, which was obvious in the loops of the flaring
region toward the end times, is not observed here. The temperatures are also totally lower in the
nonf-loops in comparison with the flaring loops. Conversely, it seems that different strips of the
non-flaring loops have relatively more similar temperature fluctuations.

As figure 8 shows, the peaks of the observed temperature periods for the loops’ strips of the
flaring active region (blue ones), and non-flaring active region (red ones), are around 18 minutes,
and 30 minutes, respectively. The temperature periods’ diversity is higher in the loops’ strips of
the flaring active region, and shorter temperature periods (less than 10 minutes, nearer to the
transverse oscillations periods) are observed in the case of the flaring loops’ strips in comparison
with the non-flaring ones. And figure 9 shows that the increasing and decreasing of temperature
range, or the difference between maximum and minimum of the temperature value (max(log( T ))min(log( T ))), is much higher on average for the loops’ strips of the flaring AR in comparison with
the loops’ strips of the non-flaring one.

V. Summery
We reported the temperature oscillations of coronal loops of a flaring active region. We selected
the flaring active region 11283 to investigate the thermal structure and treatment of its loops. This
region includes a high energy flare x2.1 and the transverse oscillations of two loops of it have been
analyzed before by Jain et al. (2015). They analyzed intensity variations in the wavelength 171
in two coronal loops of this region and detected obvious transverse oscillation with periods of
roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes for these loops (loops A and B in Figure.1b)
at the flare time. We were curious to know if the temperature variations follow the transverse
oscillations of the loops, or there is any relation or correlation between them. We also wanted to
investigate the thermal fluctuations at the flare time. As a blind test to see the specific thermal
properties of the flaring loops, we selected a LOS non-flaring active region (12194), extracted three
segments of its loops and analyzed their thermal treatment. Then we compared the temperature
treatment of the loops at the flaring region with the loops of the non-flaring region to see the
differences. We were eager to observe the probable discrepancies between flaring and non-flaring
loops in this respect.
Here we used data of three loops of the flaring active region (AR11283) around the time of the
Flare X2.1, from 22:10UT till 23:00UT on 2011 September 6, plus three loops of the non-flaring
active region (AR12194), from 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT of 2014 October 26 (marked in figures
1 and 2). To calculate the time series of the loop temperature values, we first extracted the loop
pixels in each image and then displayed the loop straightly for all the images in the time series
of different wavelengths. To do thermal analysis, we used the spatially-synthesized Gaussian
DEM forward-fitting method founded by Aschwanden et al. (2015). We calculated the peak
temperatures for each strip of the loops. Then we applied the Lomb-Scargle method to analyze
temperature oscillations of the time-series for each strip of the loops.
We observed temperature oscillations which are following the transverse loop oscillations
observed by Jain et al. (2015) for the flaring loops. Furthermore, the temperature oscillations in
these flaring loops happen before the transverse oscillations start and continue even in the time
duration after the transverse oscillations decay. As observed, the temperature oscillations do not
decay as rapidly as the transverse oscillations do. Conversely, the strips’ temperatures increase
at the end of the oscillating mode and a rather sensible rise is observed in the final temperatures
of the f-loops’ segments. The ranges of the obtained periods are from 7 min. to 28.4 min. for the
flaring loops, and from 8.5 min. to 30 min. for the non-flaring loops. With the onset of X-flare in
the F-loopA, which has a distinct transverse oscillation in the flaring time with period of roughly
2 minutes and decay time of 5 minutes, a temperature oscillation is observed with periods of
roughly 10 to 28.5 minutes in different segments of this loop. And as the transverse oscillation
decays in this interval, no special definite decay is observed in its temperature oscillations.
The temperature periods of the flaring loops are rather shorter than the temperature periods

of the non-flaring loops. The loops of the flaring region show some short temperature oscillations
periods in which some are less than 10 minutes (Table1). These kind of short periods are more
frequently observed for the loops of the flaring active region and in the case of the non-flaring
ones, are very scarce. We observed that the periods of the flaring loops have more diversity
than those of the non-flaring ones. Based on our confined observations, the non-flaring loops’
periods are longer and their temperatures’ values are totally lower. So our research showed that
thermal structures of the flaring loops differ from the non-flaring ones in the ways described
above. As temperature maps show, the temperature fluctuations are increasing at the flaring time
and around 20 min. after, in the flaring loops. This happens with some oscillations in strips’
temperature. Conversely, it seems that different strips of the non-flaring loops have relatively
more similar temperature fluctuations. The temperatures are either higher in average in the flaring loops’ segments as expected. The significances of the periods, obtained by the Lomb-Scargle
method, are calculated for each strip of each loop and the results show that these significances
for the loops’ strips of the flaring region are high and close to one, while for the loops’ strips of
the non-flaring region are less than 0.5. Hence the detected periods in the flaring loops’ strips
have high significances (near to one) and are oscillations. Whereas the detected periods in the
non-flaring loops’ strips have less significances in comparison with the flaring ones, and maybe
they are just fluctuations.
Using this method for the coronal loops showed that the oscillation modes obtained for the
temperatures of the flaring loops are very close to those of the spatial slow-mode oscillations of
the coronal loops. So the origin of temperature oscillation is probably slow-mode waves. These
kind of oscillations often occur in hot coronal loops (log( T ) > 6) of active regions especially the
ones associated with small (or micro-) flares (Wang et al. (2021)). The loops of our flaring active
region are also hot loops with the mean temperature above this range. They also show intensity
oscillations. Hence we think the above evidence confirms the slow-mode oscillations for flaring
loops. The temperature of the non-flaring loops are lower (log( T ) < 6) and as discussed above,
we believe that the observed oscillation-like periods in non-flaring loops should be more probably
related to the high amplitude fluctuations.
Comparing the loops of the flaring and non-flaring regions, we observed that the amplitudes
of the fluctuations show a discrepancy. Mean of the parameter (Max(log T)-Min(log T)) in the
FloopA, , FloopB1, FLoopB2, FloopC1, and FloopC2, are 1.21, 1.10, 0.81, 1.48, and 0.88, respectively. And for non-flaring region, mean of (Max(log T)-Min(log T)), are 0.81, 0.62, and 0.56, for
nonfloopA, B, and C respectively. Therefore the values of the quantity mean of (Max(log T)Min(log T)) for these non-flaring loops show a difference from the flaring ones and are lower.
Loops of the non-flaring active region 12194 have a relatively uniform temperature at the
beginning of the time interval, which rises slightly at its end. As the Solar Monitor reports in the
neighborhood of this region, the flaring active region 12192 exists of which between its multiple
flares, there is a c4.6 class flare occurring at 9:44UT. Therefore, it could be a possible suggestion
that the abovementioned slight temperature rise in the loops of AR 12194 (in the time interval
8:00 to 9:00) originated from the influence of an increase in the energy at the pre-flare conditions
exist in the AR 12192.
Hence as our study shows, the temperature of coronal loops of flaring AR changes in an
oscillatory manner. Compared with these non-flaring loops, the flaring loops show higher temperatures on average and higher oscillation periods with higher peaks and deeper valleys. More
accurate commentary in this respect requires more extensive statistical research and broader observations.
