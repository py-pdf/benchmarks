ABSTRACT
Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are believed to be strongly dark matter dominated and thus are considered perfect objects to study
dark matter distribution and test theories of structure formation. They possess resolved, multiple stellar populations that oﬀer new
possibilities for modeling. A promising tool for the dynamical modeling of these objects is the Schwarzschild orbit superposition
method. In this work we extend our previous implementation of the scheme to include more than one population of stars and a more
general form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested the improved approach on a nearly spherical, gas-free galaxy formed in
the cosmological context from the Illustris simulation. We modeled the binned velocity moments for stars split into two populations
by metallicity and demonstrate that in spite of larger sampling errors the increased number of constraints leads to signiﬁcantly tighter
conﬁdence regions on the recovered density and velocity anisotropy proﬁles. We then applied the method to the Fornax dSph galaxy
with stars similarly divided into two populations. In comparison with our earlier work, we ﬁnd the anisotropy parameter to be slightly
increasing, rather than decreasing, with radius and more strongly constrained. We are also able to infer anisotropy for each stellar
population separately and ﬁnd them to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

1. Introduction
Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group (Mateo
1998; Tolstoy et al. 2009) are considered to be a perfect tool to
test our current theories of structure formation involving dark
matter in the context of near-ﬁeld cosmology. The objects are
believed to be strongly dark matter dominated with mass-to-light
ratios even on the order of a few hundred solar units. Due to their
proximity they are also the only extragalactic systems where in-
dividual stars can be resolved and their velocities measured of-
fering the possibility to create interesting dynamical modeling
techniques.
The ﬁrst estimates of dark matter content in dSph galaxies
were based on a single measurement of the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the stars and the application of the virial theorem.
As the samples of the stars with kinematic measurements grew,
it became possible to estimate the proﬁle of the velocity disper-
sion and model it using the Jeans equation (Binney & Tremaine
2008). Since the stars in the galaxy can move on a variety
of orbits, from circular to radial, the degeneracy between the
anisotropy of the orbits and the mass distribution is inherent in
this type of modeling. The reason for this lies in the fact that
diﬀerent combinations of these quantities can reproduce the ve-
locity dispersion proﬁle equally well.
A way to overcome this issue, at least partially, is to resort to
higher order line-of-sight velocity moments, such as the kurto-
sis, and use the corresponding Jeans equations. Since the kurto-
sis is more sensitive to the velocity anisotropy than to the mass
distribution, useful constraints can be obtained on both. Still, the
method requires large kinematic samples to estimate the velocity
moments reliably and some assumption on the functional form
of the anisotropy (Łokas 2002; Łokas et al. 2005).
The Schwarzschild modeling technique (Schwarzschild
1979) oﬀers a diﬀerent approach to estimate the properties of
dSph galaxies without prior assumptions on the type of orbits.
It relies on building a galaxy model out of a set of best-ﬁtting
orbits probed in the range of energy and angular momenta. In
this method, the anisotropy of the stellar orbits comes out as a
result of the modeling in the same way as the density proﬁle. Al-
though it has been originally developed for large elliptical galax-
ies (van der Marel et al. 1998; Valluri et al. 2004; Gebhardt et al.
2015), it has recently been adopted for use on discrete data
characteristic of dSph galaxies and applied to a number of
dwarfs, including Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans
(Jardel & Gebhardt 2008; Jardel et al. 2013; Breddels & Helmi
2013; Breddels et al. 2013; Kowalczyk et al. 2019).
Many dSph galaxies show signs of the presence of multiple
stellar populations resulting from a few star formation episodes
(Bellazzini et al. 2001; del Pino et al. 2015; Fabrizio et al. 2016;
Pace et al. 2020). This observation oﬀers a way to improve the
modeling methods since, assuming dynamical equilibrium, all
populations are supposed to be inﬂuenced by the same under-
lying gravitational potential of the galaxy, but they have dif-
ferent distributions so more constraints can be imposed during
the modeling. This approach was ﬁrst used by Battaglia et al.
(2008) to model the mass distribution in the Sculptor dSph
galaxy. A few attempts have also been made to constrain the
inner slope of the dark matter proﬁle in dSph galaxies using
this technique (Walker & Peñarrubia 2011; Amorisco & Evans
2012; Hayashi et al. 2018) in order to resolve the so-called cusp-
core problem. It has been shown to be diﬃcult, however, due

to the nonsphericity of the dwarfs that introduces biases in such
measurements (Kowalczyk et al. 2013; Genina et al. 2018).
In our recent papers (Kowalczyk et al. 2017, 2018, 2019) we
developed the Schwarzschild technique in the form applicable to
binned velocity moments of a single tracer and veriﬁed its abil-
ity to reproduce the mass distribution and velocity anisotropy of
simulated galaxies. We have also studied biases resulting from
the nonsphericity of the modeled objects. Later, we applied the
method to model the kinematics of the Fornax dSph galaxy esti-
mating its mass and anisotropy proﬁles with unprecedented pre-
cision.
In this paper we extend our Schwarzschild modeling tech-
nique to include multiple stellar populations with the aim to
constrain the properties of dSph galaxies even more strongly.
We test our approach on a realistic simulated galaxy formed in
the cosmological context, originating from the Illustris project
(Vogelsberger et al. 2014a). Although no precise analogues of
dSph galaxies are available in this simulation because of the res-
olution, we use a more massive galaxy but with properties oth-
erwise similar to dSphs. The reliability of the modeling does not
depend on the particular value of the mass so we believe these
tests to be viable. We do not attempt to constrain the inner dark
matter density proﬁle (which is poorly resolved anyway) but try
to put tighter limits on the estimates of the mass and anisotropy
proﬁles. Finally, we apply the improved method to the available
kinematic data for the distinct stellar populations of the Fornax
dSph.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present
the data for the simulated galaxy as well as their splitting into
stellar populations and mock observations along the main axes.
Section 3 contains an overview of our modeling method, the ap-
plication of the method to all stars and to two populations, and
a comparison of the results obtained with these two approaches.
The results of the application of the method to the Fornax dSph
galaxy are presented in Section 4. We discuss our ﬁndings and
summarize the paper in Section 5.
2. Mock data
2.1. Selection of the simulated galaxy
In order to test our modeling method on realistic simulated
data, we decided to use a galaxy from the Illustris project
(Vogelsberger et al. 2014a,b; Genel et al. 2014; Nelson et al.
2015), namely the Illustris-1 cosmological simulation. This sim-
ulation follows the formation and evolution of galaxies from the
early Universe to the present by solving gravity and hydrody-
namics, as well as modeling of star formation, galactic winds,

magnetic ﬁelds, and the feedback from black holes. Although
dwarf galaxies that are of our interest here are not resolved in the
suite, this can be easily overcome with the appropriate choice of
the object and the treatment of data.
As the key properties of dSph galaxy equivalents we iden-
tiﬁed: the lack of gas, the lack of a black hole, a low spin,
the stellar mass much smaller than the dark matter mass and a
nearly spherical shape. The last condition was adopted in an at-
tempt to avoid any strong bias introduced by the spherical mod-
eling of a nonspherical object. Moreover, we required the galaxy
to possess a signiﬁcant number of both stellar and dark mat-
ter particles (over 105), and a well resolved center. Due to the
large softening scale for dark matter particles in the simulation
(ǫDM = 1.42 kpc), we looked for an object in which even the
more concentrated stellar population (see Section 2.2) extended
over 43 kpc so that the region aﬀected by the numerical artifacts
was enclosed within 2-3 innermost data bins (we used 20 linearly
spaced spatial bins, see Section 3.1).
Out of 27345 galaxies listed in the catalog of stellar circu-
larities, angular momenta, and axis ratios published by the Illus-
tris team (Genel et al. 2015) containing subhalos with the stellar
mass larger than 109 M⊙, only a few met our restrictive require-

ments. We decided to use a galaxy labeled as subhalo 16960.
All the relevant properties of the galaxy are given in Table 1,
including numbers of particles and total masses for both compo-
nents, and details on the shape of the stellar component: the axis
ratios minor to major (shortest to longest) c/a, intermediate to
major b/a, and the triaxiality parameter T = (a2 − b2)/(a2 − c2).
We distinguish between the half-mass radius provided in the Il-
lustris database and the half-number radius r1/2, which we use
for further calculations in this paper. The diﬀerence between the
two comes from a small gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio
with the distance from the galactic center. Since in our approach
we treat stars as equal-mass particles and refer to number den-
sities (multiplied by the mean mass of a stellar particle when
needed), the application of the half-number radius is more self-
consistent.

the right). Diﬀerent lines show proﬁles for all available stars (in red), the metal-rich population I (in orange), and the metal-poor population II (in
blue). Thin vertical lines indicate r0 (see text) and the outer boundary of the spectroscopic data.
2.2. Splitting the stars into populations
Our chosen galaxy shows a complex formation history under-
going multiple mergers which result in extended star formation
with a few star formation bursts. The last wet merger, that is a
merger with an object containing gas, happens at 6.9 Gyr from
the beginning of the simulation, whereas the last dry merger (no
gas transfer) at 12.1 Gyr, giving the galaxy enough time to regain
dynamical equilibrium. We present the star formation rate (SFR)
as a function of time (the age of the Universe) in Fig. 1, where
these last mergers are indicated with black and gray vertical ar-
rows. In Fig. 2 we show the distribution of stars as a function of
their metallicity (in solar units) and the time of formation. In or-
der to divide the stellar sample into two populations we cut it in
half based on the metallicity index of each stellar particle. This
split is indicated in Fig. 2 with the vertical line. With satisfying
accuracy it separates the stars born before and after 4 Gyr since
the start of the simulation, which corresponds to the formation
time before and after the end of the second major star burst, as
shown in Fig. 1. We refer to the metal-rich stars as population I
and to the metal-poor as population II, following the commonly
used nomenclature in astronomy.
In Fig. 3 we present maps of the projected stellar mass den-
sity, line-of-sight velocity, and line-of-sight velocity dispersion
for both populations obtained by projecting the galaxy along its
principal axes. The orientation was determined from the iner-
tia tensor calculated from all stars within the half-number radius
r1/2 and therefore is the same in both panels. The two popula-
tions diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the spatial distribution and kinemat-
ics with the metal-rich (considered to be younger) population I
being more concentrated but having lower central velocity dis-
persion. Both populations show a weak rotation signal at large
distances from the center.

=
1 − (σ2

φ)/(2σ2
r), where σi are velocity dispersions in spherical coordi-
nates (Binney & Tremaine 2008), describes the orbital structure
of galaxies. It is one of the most important dynamical properties
of bound systems which cannot be inferred directly from ob-
servations and has to be recovered by dynamical modeling. The
proﬁles of the anisotropy parameter β as well as the radial σr
and tangential σt = [(σ2
θ + σ2
φ)/2]1/2 velocity dispersions for our
simulated galaxy are presented in the consecutive columns of
Fig. 4. Throughout the paper we use red, orange, and blue colors
to indicate values calculated or recovered for all stars, popula-
tion I, and population II, respectively. The two rows of the ﬁgure
show the behavior of the parameters at diﬀerent scales. The top
row plots the proﬁles with the distance from the center of the
galaxy in the logarithmic scale and shows the drop of anisotropy
at the outer edges of the object. The bottom row uses the linear
distance scale and focuses on the main body of the galaxy.
Figure 5 shows the surface number density proﬁles of the
stars as measured in diﬀerent directions. We can see that while
the diﬀerent subsamples have quite distinguishable proﬁles, the
diﬀerence between the lines of sight is small because the galaxy
is close to spherical.
2.3. Observables
We generated nine sets of mock data by observing all stars and
each population separately along the principal axes determined
from all stars. For the observables to be used in the modeling we
divided the stars into 20 bins spaced linearly in distance from
the center of the galaxy up to 50 kpc, measuring the fraction
of the total number of stars and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th proper
moments of the line-of-sight velocity deﬁned in Eq. 8 and 9
of Kowalczyk et al. (2018). The proﬁles of these quantities are
shown in consecutive rows in Fig. 6. Columns correspond to dif-
ferent lines of sight, from the left to the right: along the major,
intermediate, and minor axis of the galaxy. For clarity of the ﬁg-
ure, in each panel we indicate only the error bars for one of the
data sets. However, as the number of stars in a sample remains
roughly constant between the lines of sight, the error bars are
very similar among the panels in a given row.
Although in our previous studies of the reliability of
the Schwarzschild modeling and its applications to real data
(Kowalczyk et al. 2017, 2018, 2019) we approximated the den-
sity proﬁle of the tracer with the Sérsic formula, we found that it
does not provide a good approximation of the data for the simu-
lated galaxy considered here. We therefore ﬁt the projected den-
sity proﬁle with the King formula (King 1962)

In this section we brieﬂy present our modeling method and its

aim was to recover the proﬁles of the total mass and the velocity
anisotropy.

namely we model the total mass proﬁle with the mass-to-light
ratio Υ varying with radius:

as an algebraic sum of values for populations I and II. To avoid large numbers in the ﬁgure, Υ0 was divided by the mean mass of a stellar particle.
where r is the distance from the center of the galaxy, r0 is a
constant, while Υ0, a, and c are the parameters of a model. We
have assumed log r0 = 0.33 which corresponds to three softening
scales for stellar particles in the Illustris simulation.
We probed the parameter a ∈ [0 : 1.3] with a step ∆a = 0.04
and c ∈ [1.1 : 2.9] with a step ∆c = 0.2, imposing the require-
ment on the total density proﬁle to be monotonically decreasing
with radius. For each set of parameters and for each line of sight
we generated 1200 orbits using 100 values of energy (expressed
with the radius of a circular orbit) spaced logarithmically and
12 values of the relative angular momentum spaced linearly. The
outer radius of the orbit library, that is the apocenter of the most
extended orbit, was set to rout = 165 kpc in order to cover over
0.999 of the total stellar mass based on the ﬁtted King proﬁle
parameters.
We ﬁt the kinematics weighted with the fraction of mass with
the constrained least squares algorithm where diﬀerent values
of Υ0 were obtained with a simple transformation of velocities
given by Eq. 12, 13, and 15 in Kowalczyk et al. (2018). In or-
der to smooth out the numerical artifacts, the three-dimensional
χ2 spaces were then interpolated with 12-order polynomials
(∼ a4c4Υ4
0) that were further used to determine the global min-
imums (identiﬁed as the best-ﬁtting models) and 1, 2, 3 σ con-
ﬁdence levels which for three parameters correspond to ∆χ2 =
3.53, 8.02, 14.2 (Press et al. 1992).
3.2. Application to mock data
In the following we present the direct and inferred results of
the Schwarzschild modeling of the data sets described in Sec-
tion 2.3.
First, Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the absolute values of
the χ2 as a function of three parameters of the mass-to-light ra-
tio. In order to avoid unnecessary repetitions, we include only
the plot for the mock data obtained by observing the Illustris
galaxy along its major axis as the others are qualitatively similar.
The four panels refer to ﬁts for all stars (top left), the metal-rich
population I (bottom left), the metal-poor population II (bottom
right), and the one named "populations" (top right) which is the
algebraic sum of values for both populations.
As our parametrization of the mass-to-light ratio is not intu-

axes. In rows: derived mass-to-light ratio, total density, total mass, and anisotropy parameter. In columns: observations along the major, interme-
diate, and minor axis, respectively. Green lines indicate values for the best-ﬁt models whereas the colored areas of decreasing intensity show the
1, 2, and 3 σ conﬁdence levels. The true values are presented as black lines. Thin vertical lines mark the values of r0 and the outer range of the

and right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 for the results obtained for
all stars and the populations, respectively. We further calculate
the total density (second rows) and the total mass content (third
rows). We include the obtained orbit anisotropy within the mod-
eled range in the bottom rows. The consecutive columns present
the results for the observations along the major, intermediate,
and minor axis. Green lines indicate values for the best-ﬁt mod-
els whereas the colored areas of decreasing intensity correspond
to 1, 2, and 3 σ conﬁdence regions obtained as extreme values al-
lowed by the models with χ2 within a given region. In each panel
the true values from the simulation are presented with black lines
while thin vertical lines mark the values of r0 and the outer range
of the data sets beyond which the reliability of results drops sig-
niﬁcantly. The true mass-to-light ratio proﬁle was obtained by
dividing the total mass by the ﬁtted King proﬁles, therefore the
drop at 100 kpc is the numerical artifact occurring at the very
outskirts of the galaxy.
Whereas in the right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 the resulting
anisotropy is obtained from the ﬁt of all stars and uses only the
location of global minimum and conﬁdence levels from two pop-
ulations (as in the top right panel of Fig. 7), in Fig. 9 we present
another method of calculating the anisotropy. In the second and
third row we show the derived proﬁles for population I and II
separately and combine them as stellar mass weighted average
in the top row. As in previous ﬁgures, three columns refer to the
diﬀerent lines of sight whereas the narrow fourth one shows the
behavior of the true proﬁles outside the modeled range which, as
we noticed in our previous studies, in a limited way inﬂuences
the results. Such an impact is understandable since the stars at
larger distances from the center are still included in the line-of-
sight measurements.
3.3. Comparison of ﬁtting results
The main strength of the two populations method comes from
tracing the underlying gravitational potential at diﬀerent scales.
As can be seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 7, population I, which
is more concentrated, is also more sensitive to Υ0, but gives
weaker constraints on a or c. On the other hand, population II
attempts to reproduce the total mass content at larger distances
as well, therefore showing stronger coupling between the param-
eters.
The global minimums of the χ2 distributions for both ap-
proaches, that is modeling one and two populations, which we
identify as the best-ﬁtting models, closely coincide showing that
there is no internal bias in the improved method. However, sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences can be observed when comparing the conﬁ-
dence levels, mainly at 1 and 3 σ. Namely, we ﬁnd that using
two populations, the constraints we obtain on the density and
anisotropy proﬁle are much stronger.
Additionally, the more accurate method allows us to study
other eﬀects and biases, for example the consequences of the
nonsphericity of the modeled object. Whereas for the ﬁt of all
stars the true values of the density, mass, and anisotropy proﬁles
are contained within 1 σ conﬁdence regions, the results for the
populations are more or less biased depending on the axis. They
are well reproduced for the observation along the intermediate
axis, for which the eﬀects of nonsphericity seem to cancel out,
and more biased for the remaining lines of sight. We notice a
trend from under- to overestimation of the anisotropy when go-
ing from the major to the minor axis.

4. Modeling Fornax dSph
In this section we present the application of our Schwarzschild
modeling scheme to the observational data for the Fornax dSph
galaxy obtained by del Pino et al. (2015) and del Pino et al.
(2017). This study is a follow-up of the work of Kowalczyk et al.
(2019) and can be directly compared to the results presented
there. Moreover, we refer the reader to these previous publica-
tions for details on the origin of data and our procedures used
for cleaning the spectroscopic sample.
Similarly to the approach introduced in Section 2.2, we di-
vided all available stars into two equal-size populations based on
their metallicity and then cross-correlated the samples with the
data used in Kowalczyk et al. (2019). The metallicity histogram
of the ﬁnal spectroscopic sample is shown in Fig. 10. Addition-
ally, we color-coded each bin with the population it has been
assigned to, namely orange or blue for population I or II. Inter-
estingly, the case of Fornax is similar to our simulated galaxy
as the split at [Fe/H]= −1 also captures an important feature
of the object’s star formation history, separating stars into sub-
samples older and younger than 6 Gyr, as shown in Fig. 12 of
del Pino et al. (2015) and Fig. 8 of del Pino et al. (2017). The
numbers of stars contained in the samples of all stars, popula-
tion I, and population II are given in Table 2, where the indices
"phot" and "spec" refer to the photometric and kinematic sam-
ples. The sum of stars in the populations is lower than in the
sample of all stars since only stars with reliable measurements
of metallicity could be included.

log r = −0.16, is also used as the minimum of the mass-to-light
ratio proﬁle (r0 in Eq. 5). The ﬁtted parameters of the proﬁles,
that is the normalization N0, the Sérsic radius RS, and the Sérsic
parameter m, are included in the second part of Table 2.
Figure12 presents the proﬁles of the observables used in the
Schwarzschild modeling: the fraction of stars and the 2nd, 3rd,

blue, respectively). The error bars indicate 1 σ sampling errors.
The parameter space for Υ(r) has been probed as follows:
a ∈ [0 : 1.85] with a step ∆a = 0.05 and c ∈ [1.2 : 6] with a
step ∆c = 0.2. We point out that in Kowalczyk et al. (2019) the
parameter c was ﬁxed at c = 3 and now we ﬁt it as a free pa-
rameter. As for the mock data in Section 3.2, diﬀerent values of
Υ0 were obtained with the transformation of velocity moments
within the χ2 ﬁtting routine. The values of ∆χ2 for all stars and
the populations are shown in the two panels of Fig. 13 (left and
right-hand side, respectively). Due to the dense coverage of the
grid, we decided to include only the values within 3 σ from the
ﬁtted minimums (see Section 3.1).
The proﬁles of the mass-to-light ratio, total density, total
mass, and velocity anisotropy resulting from the χ2 distributions
are presented in the consecutive rows of Fig. 14. The anisotropy
proﬁle for the populations is based on the ﬁt of all stars but using

(Kowalczyk et al. 2019), we obtained higher estimates of the en-
closed total mass at larger radii. In particular, for the mass en-
closed within 1.8 kpc we get Mall(< 1.8 kpc) = 3.87+1.48

M⊙ from the ﬁt for all stars and Mpops(< 1.8 kpc) = 4.71+0.87
−1.13 ×
108 M⊙ from the ﬁt of populations, while previously we had
Mold(< 1.8 kpc) = 3.7+1.4
−1.3 × 108 M⊙.
Interestingly, despite the signiﬁcant shift of the position of
χ2
min (to c = 4.2 for all stars and 3.6 for populations), the ob-
tained proﬁle of the anisotropy parameter remains decreasing or
ﬂat for all stars but changes to increasing from 0 to 0.5 for the
populations. Nevertheless, even in the latter case the previous
result agrees with the new ﬁnding within 1 σ.
The detailed analysis of the anisotropy is shown in Fig. 15
where the middle and bottom panels present the proﬁles ob-
tained for each population separately. We notice that the proﬁle
for population I is decreasing or has a local minimum whereas
for population II is increasing (from −0.25 to 0.5 for the best-
ﬁtting model). Since population I is more concentrated, the last
bins contain very few stars, which limits their credibility. The
top panel of Fig. 15 presents the anisotropy of all stars calcu-
lated as a weighted superposition of two populations. With such
approach we still obtain the increasing proﬁle (from 0 to 0.5) but
the previous result agrees with it only within 2 σ.
Since Fornax dSph is signiﬁcantly elongated with the pro-
jected ellipticity of ǫ = 0.30 ± 0.01 (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou
1995), we anticipate some bias in the obtained results caused
by the spherically symmetric modeling. Kowalczyk et al. (2018)
studied such bias in an axisymmetric simulated object qualita-
tively similar to Fornax and identiﬁed diﬀerences in the system-
atic errors depending on whether the galaxy was observed along
its major or minor axis. Assuming that Fornax is observed along
the line of sight in between these extremes, we expect the total
mass proﬁle to be slightly overestimated and the anisotropy to be
underestimated, further strengthening the likelihood of the real
anisotropy to be radial and its proﬁle to be growing with radius
with respect to the results of Kowalczyk et al. (2019).
Both constant (like for our population I) and growing (pop-
ulation II) anisotropy proﬁles can arise from biased modeling
of the real growing proﬁle by observing an object along the
minor and major axis, respectively. However, for the bias to
occur in two populations presented here, their inner orienta-
tions would need to be opposite. Since such morphological fea-
tures are not supported by the photometric studies of Fornax
(del Pino et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019) which rather ﬁnd a good
spatial alignment between the stellar populations, we conclude
that the anisotropy proﬁles of the two populations modeled in
this work are indeed signiﬁcantly distinct.
Finally, it is worth noticing that the so-called mass-follows-
light model, that is the one following from the assumption that
the total density traces the stellar distribution, is no longer sup-
ported by the ﬁt of the populations. With our parametrization,
the mass-follows-light model corresponds to a = 0 and whereas
it is enclosed within 3 σ for the ﬁt of all stars, as was the case
in Kowalczyk et al. (2019), the allowed values for the improved
method are much larger, as demonstrated by the right panel of
Fig. 13.
5. Summary and discussion
Building on the previously created implementation of the
Schwarzschild orbit superposition method focused on modeling
dSph galaxies of the Local Group (Kowalczyk et al. 2017, 2018,
2019), we improved our tool by introducing multiple stellar pop-
ulations. Such an improvement is desirable and justiﬁed since
many of the dwarfs show signs of multiple star formation bursts
or extended star formation episodes. As the diﬀerent populations
trace the common underlying gravitational potential, one may
expect a signiﬁcant improvement in the estimates of not only the
total mass content but also the orbit anisotropy since this robust
modeling technique reproduces the anisotropy as a by-product
of the modeling rather than taking it as an assumption.
We have tested our hypothesis by modeling mock data gener-
ated from a galaxy formed in the Illustris simulation. Due to the
limitations of the resolution, we chose a galaxy of mass a few or-
ders of magnitude larger than the estimated masses of classical
dwarfs. Still, the galaxy possessed appropriate qualitative char-
acteristics, such as the lack of gas and an almost spherical shape,

that made it a good test bed for modeling techniques applica-
ble to dSph galaxies. We applied our approach to all data and
to two stellar populations separately, comparing the accuracy of
the obtained results. Although the addition of the second tracer
seemingly increases the number of constraints twice, the incre-
ment is somewhat compromised by the sampling errors since the
number of stars in each sample is then reduced. Still, we found
strong improvements in the accuracy of the method when us-
ing two populations. The results of the modeling show that the
density and velocity anisotropy proﬁles are more strongly con-
strained, most importantly at the 3 σ level, that is the range of
allowed values is much narrower.
Similarly to the conclusions of Kowalczyk et al. (2018) who
explored the eﬀects of nonsphericity using large and small
data samples, the comparison of results presented in the left-
and right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 suggests that the improved
method using two stellar populations gives more precise but less
accurate outcome. However, in both studies the apparent dete-
rioration of the reliability is a consequence of modeling of a
nonspherical object. In both cases, a simpler approach (much
smaller data samples or using one stellar population) resulted

in larger ﬁnal uncertainties, usually containing the true values
within 1 σ conﬁdence region. On the other hand, the improved
methods exhibit substantially reduced uncertainties, highlighting
the underlying bias.
Our method parametrizes the total mass content with the
mass-to-light ratio varying with radius as a power-law in the log-
log scale. We made two main changes with respect to our previ-
ous work: we added a third parameter c controlling the steepness
of the mass-to-light ratio proﬁle (previously ﬁxed at the value of
3) and allowed for diﬀerent stellar density proﬁles (previously
only Sérsic, now also King). These changes are of course cou-
pled since diﬀerent density proﬁles require diﬀerent exponents to
reproduce the same mass proﬁle. It is visible also in our results
since the King proﬁle applied in the simulated galaxy gave us
values of c lower than 3. Nevertheless, we decided to use diﬀer-
ent density proﬁles to make our method more general and appli-
cable to objects, such as our Illustris galaxy, for which the Sérsic
formula does not provide a good approximation of the density
distribution.
Finally, we applied the improved method to the data for the
Fornax dSph galaxy. Due to the addition of another free param-
eter in our functional form for the mass-to-light ratio, our re-
sults for modeling all stars are slightly diﬀerent from the ones
Article number, page 11 of 12

obtained in Kowalczyk et al. (2019). However, in terms of the
total density and mass distribution the estimates obtained here
agree very well with those earlier results in the range covered
by the data. Therefore, the detailed comparison with other esti-
mates from the literature presented in Kowalczyk et al. (2019) is
still valid and we do not repeat it here.
A more signiﬁcant diﬀerence with respect to these previous
estimates is seen in the results of modeling two populations in
Fornax. In this case we ﬁnd the anisotropy to be slightly increas-
ing rather than decreasing with radius and, most importantly, the
conﬁdence regions for this parameter, as well as for the den-
sity, are much narrower. We were thus able to obtain tighter con-
straints on the properties of Fornax, which means that the im-
proved method is successful. For the ﬁrst time, we were also able
to deduce the velocity anisotropy proﬁles for each of the popula-
tions separately. We found that the more concentrated, metal-rich
population I has a decreasing anisotropy proﬁle while the more
extended, metal-poor population II has the anisotropy increasing
with radius. This ﬁnding may partially explain the large spread
of the anisotropy values obtained in the literature and summa-
rized in Table 2 and 3 of Kowalczyk et al. (2019), which were
often based on modeling subsamples of our spectroscopic data

For both studied objects we split the stars into two popula-
tions by dividing them in half based on their metallicity, Z (in
solar units), for the Illustris galaxy and [Fe/H] for Fornax. Such
a method is approximate but justiﬁed. Both galaxies have com-
plex star formation history with multiple star formation bursts, as
demonstrated by Fig. 1 in this work and Fig. 7 in del Pino et al.
(2013), producing multiple stellar populations which cannot be
easily tracked as the metallicity is a good but not perfect proxy
for the stellar age. Moreover, the metallicity histograms for both
objects are approximately unimodal not allowing for a conve-
nient separation. More reﬁned methods of division have been
suggested in the literature, for example in the form of the likeli-
hood function based on the position, velocity, and metallicity in-
dex (Walker & Peñarrubia 2011). However, the likelihood func-
tion requires many assumptions which introduce additional un-
certainties into the treatment of the data. On the other hand, our
approach ensures the maximization of each sample (and there-
fore minimization of sampling errors) while capturing the im-
portant features of the star formation history.
Further improvements to the Schwarzschild modeling
method are certainly possible. One way to proceed would be to
include the modeling of the proper motions of the stars. For now,
measurements of transverse velocities are available only for the
brightest stars in dSph galaxies, but even small samples of this
type could provide further constraints on the models, as demon-
strated by Strigari et al. (2007) and Massari et al. (2020).
Acknowledgements. We are grateful to Andrés del Pino for providing the data for
the Fornax dSph and to the Illustris team for making their simulations publicly
available. Useful comments from the anonymous referee are kindly appreciated.
