1 INTRODUCTION
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous transients that last for mi-
croseconds to milliseconds and occur at extragalactic to cosmo-
logical distances (e.g.
 Lorimer et al.
 2007
;
 Thornton et al.
 2013
;
Macquart et al.
 2020
). The estimated high radio luminosities and
associatedbrightnesstemperaturesrequiredtoproducetheseshort-
timescale energetic events at such distances are what makes them
intriguing(
Petro˙etal.
2021
;
Caleb&Keane

).Theyhavebeen
observed to emit from

110MHz

8GHz
, though not yet across
a wide and continuous frequency band due to the variable band-
limited spectra of the single pulses. Over 600 FRBs have been dis-
covered

Thepersistentemissionispoweredbythenebulaofrelativisticelec-
trons and magnetic ˝elds in˛ated by the magnetar ˛ares (
Margalit
et al.
 2019
). The existence of persistent emission associated with
FRBs could provide vital clues to their origin. Moreover, potential
candidates and models for FRB progenitors predict counterparts
in the X-ray an TeV bands. For example, a model by
 Lyubarsky
(
2014
)predictsmillisecondoutburstsofTeVemissionaccompany-

20180924B, 20181112A, 20190102C and 20190608B were con-

luminousastheoneassociatedwithFRB20121102Awasdetected
for the ASKAP FRBs (
Bhandari et al.
 2020
). While the true age of
FRB 121102A is unknown, models based on polarization studies
predict the age to be
˘
6

17
years (
Hilmarsson et al.
 2021
). It is
possible that younger, more active FRBs like FRB 20121102A are
associated with persistent radio emission while the emission might
havefadedovertimefortheolderones.Thepossibilityofrepeating
FRBs not being so uncommon after all (
Ravi
 2019
) along with the
increasing arcsecond localisations suggests that we are entering an
era where we can begin to look for evidence of multiple classes by
studyingFRBhostgalaxiesandmulti-wavelengthcounterparts.

sion in the host galaxies of one apparent one-o˙ source (FRB

2 OBSERVATIONSANDDATAREDUCTION
2.1 MeerKATobservations
The MeerKAT 64-parabolic-dish array (
Jonas & MeerKAT Team
2016
;
 Mauch et al.
 2020
) is located in the Northern Karoo desert
near Carnarvon, South Africa. Each o˙set Gregorian" parabolic
dish antenna has an e˙ective diameter of 13.5m. The inner core of
the array contains 48 of the 64 dishes in a 1km radius, while the
remaining16dishesarespreadoutwardupto8km.Theshortestand

atthecentralfrequency,
of the L-band receiver used here, of 1283MHz. Multi-epoch ob-
servations of the FRB ˝elds were conducted with the MeerKAT
array (Project ID: SCI-20190418-VC-01) at L-band (856MHz to
1712MHz). Details of the MeerKAT observations are presented
in Table
 1
. Only Stokes I (total intensity) of the MeerKAT ob-
servations are considered in this paper. The data correlation was
donewiththeSKARABcorrelator(

in a frequency resolution of

ingthesemi-automatedMeerKATdataanalysispipelines-
>G:0C

(
Heywood

).
2.1.1 Imaginganalysis
The
>G:0C
pipeline employs a collection of publicly available ra-
dio interferometry data reduction software. The ˝nal data prod-
3
https://ascl.net/code/v/2627
ucts, including reduced and calibrated visibility data (including
self-calibration), continuum (including sub-band) images as well
as diagnostic plots, are provided by the pipeline. The customary
con˝guration of the
>G:0C
pipeline incorporates ˛agging, cross-
calibration and self-calibration processes. In the ˛agging process,
thelow-gainbandpassedges(856MHzto880MHzand1658MHz
to1800MHz)are˛aggedonallbaselines,alongwiththelocationof
the Galactic neutral hydrogen line at 1419.8MHz to 1421.3MHz.
Several other radio frequency interference (RFI) prone regions of
the spectrum are then ˛agged on baselines shorter than 600 m.
Then, other possible RFI a˙ected data are ˛agged out using the
CASA routines r˛ag and tfcrop for the calibrators, and using the
tricolourpackageforthetarget˝elds.
Thecross-calibrationstepsusing
>G:0C
werestandard,includ-
ingsettingthe˛uxscaleandderivingcorrectionsforresidualdelay
calibration, bandpass and time-varying gain. The
>G:0C
pipeline
uses the customary tasks from the CASA (
McMullin et al.
 2007
)
suite for cross-calibration. After applying all the corrections to the
target˝eld,wechannel-averagedthedatasetbyafactorof˝vechan-
nelsbeforesplittingoutthesciencetarget.Thisisconsistentwithour
sciencegoals,sincetherelicsourceswetargetareinthecentralparts
of our ˝elds, reducing the e˙ect of smearing through the channel
averaging. To deconvolve and image the target data, the WSClean
imager (
O˙ringa et al.
 2014
) was used, with the multiscale and
wideband deconvolution algorithms enabled to better allow imag-
ing of the di˙use emission present in the our ˝elds. Deconvolution
wasperformedintensub-bandimagesofeach82MHzwide-band.
WSClean generates the multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) map, in
joined-channel deconvolution mode, with a central frequency of
1283MHz. In other words, the MFS map is a full bandwidth map.
In WSClean, each of the sub-bands is deconvolved separately with
an initially high mask of 20
f
rms
(using the auto masking function
provided by WSClean), to generate an artefact-free model of the
target ˝eld for the self-calibration process. This masking threshold
was iteratively reduced to a value of 3
f
rms
in the ˝nal iteration
of imaging. The
>G:0C
pipeline uses the customary tasks from the
Cubicalsoftware(
Kenyonetal.
2018
)forself-calibration.

2.2 e-MERLINObservations
To constrain the position of the persistent continuum emission
associated with FRB20190714A, we conducted L-band (centre
frequency of 1.51GHz) observations of the target with the en-
hanced Multi-Element Remote-Linked Interferometer Network, e-
MERLIN array in the United Kingdom (project code: CY10003)
on 13 January, 2021 (see Section
 3.1.2
). Six antennas were used
including the 75-m Lovell telescope and the target pointing cen-
tre was R.A.

Due to the lack of MeerKAT primary beam correction, we
did not compare the ˛ux densities of the discrete sources with
their NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory) VLA (Very
LargeArray)SkySurvey(NVSS)counterparts.However,Chibueze
et al. (2021, submitted) con˝rmed that the overall ˛ux densities
obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS are in good agreement with
each other within errors of
˘
5
%. We compared the astrometry of
the discrete radio sources obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS in
Figure
 1
. The position uncertainty of the MeerKAT ranges from
0
Ł
00
2 (close to the centre of the primary beam) to a few arcseconds
towards the edge of the primary beam. The scatter observed in
Figure

ismostlyduetotheprobabilityofthecentroidsofemission
in the

MeerKAT'sresolutionandpartlyduetohigherpositionuncertainty
of the fainter sources. Therefore, we conclude that our MeerKAT
data are well calibrated and the ˛ux density and astrometry are as
accurateastheerrorsindicate.

We estimate the probability of a chance alignment of a back-

4 DISCUSSION
Of the targeted FRB ˝elds reported here, only FRB 20190714A
is observed to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio con-
tinuum source. We obtain an upper limit of
˘
15
`
Jy beam

1
for
FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A, respectively, and a peak inten-
sity of
˘
53
`
Jy beam

1
for the emission coincident with FRB
20190714A. This source is detected at both epochs with similar
intensitieswithinthemeasuredrmsoftheimages(seeTables
1
and
2
 for details). The values in the Table
 2
 are derived by carrying
out 2D Gaussian ˝t using similar ellipses enclosing the detected
persistent emission. The average ˛ux density is
˘
3
times less than
thatofthepersistentsourceassociatedwithFRBs20121102A,one
of the most proli˝c repeaters, located at
I

º
. Persistent
radioemissionfromFRB20201124AwasdetectedbytheuGMRT
(
Wharton et al.
 2021
) and the JVLA (
Ricci et al.
 2021
) on angular
scales of a few arcseconds. However, it is resolved out at scales of
˘
0
Ł
1
arcsecondswiththeEuropeanVLBINetwork(
Marcoteetal.
2021
) suggesting that it is not a compact source directly associated
with the FRB. In contrast, the other localised, proli˝c repeating
FRB20180916Ahasnopersistentradiocounterpart.
In the image in Figure
 3
 one can see that the persistent radio
source lies at the edge of the optical extent of the host galaxy
as seen in PanSTARRS observations (
Heintz et al.

˛ux density we measured for FRB 20190714A is a factor of
˘
10
lower than FRB20201124A, but FRB 20190714A is also a factor
2.6moredistant.Therefore,the˛uxdensitieswouldbecomparable
iftheywereatsimilardistances.
Given the resolution of MeerKAT we are unable to de˝ni-
tively state whether the persistent emission is associated with a
star-formingregionortheFRBitself.However, theincreasedreso-
lutionwiththee-MERLINbaselineswouldtendtofavouracompact
source similar to the one observed in FRB 20121102A. One of the
leading models to explain the bursts from, and radio counterpart
to FRB 20121102A, is a young nebula powered ˛aring magnetar
embedded in a 2050 year-old supernova remnant (
Beloborodov
2017
;
 Metzger et al.
 2019
). The lack of a bright persistent radio
source associated with the repeater FRB 20180916A suggests that
it is comparatively older at
&
200

500
years and the persistent
radiosourcemayhavefaded.Inthemodelby
Metzgeretal.
(
2019
),
the nebula is suggested to contribute signi˝cantly to the rotation
measure and dispersion measure (DM), as well as to the persis-
tent radio luminosity. These values are expected to decrease on a
timescale of a few decades to centuries. Given the association of a
comparatively fainter persistent source, FRB 20190714A may po-
tentially be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB
20121102A and FRB 20180916A. Millisecond magnetars formed
through standard astrophysical channels such as hydrogen poor su-
perluminous supernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts are
consistentwiththeprogenitorsofFRBsexpectedinlow-metallicity
dwarf galaxies with high speci˝c star-formation rate such as for
FRB20121102A.However,

The X-ray and VHE observations with
Swift
and H.E.S.S.
allows us to probe non-thermal persistent emission associated to
the FRB host galaxy or its source. Recently, H.E.S.S. observed

emissions. In the case of existence of X-ray non-thermal outbursts,
the lack of VHE detection could indicate that inverse Compton is
weak in the vicinity of the magnetars or that the VHE gamma-ray
emissionisquenched.Thislatterscenariocouldbeexplainedbythe
fact that inverse Compton is taking place too close to the magne-
tar's surface, where pair production and photon splitting could be
responsibleforsigni˝cantenergylosses(

No persistent emissions were detected towards FRB
20190711A and FRB 20171019A in our MeerKAT observations
(see Figures

,
 8
, and
 9
), therefore no follow up observations were
conductedtowardsthoseFRBs.
5 CONCLUSIONS
Several FRB models envision persistent emission to be associated
with these sources. In this paper, we conducted radio observations
of three FRBs (FRB 20190714A, 20190711A and 20171019A),
and also a multi-wavelength campaign on one of these (FRB
20171019A).
