Key Points:

• The Cassini state obliquity of Mercury’s mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid

planet by no more than 0.01 arcmin.

• For a core magnetic ﬁeld above 0.3 mT, electromagnetic coupling locks the ﬂuid and solid

cores into a common precession motion.

• The larger the inner core is, the more the obliquity of the polar moment of inertia ap-

proaches that expected for a rigid planet.

Abstract
We present a model of the Cassini state of Mercury that comprises an inner core, a ﬂuid core
and a mantle. Our model includes inertial and gravitational torques between interior regions,
and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the boundaries of the ﬂuid core. We show
that the coupling between Mercury’s interior regions is suﬃciently strong that the obliquity of
the mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01 arcmin. The man-
tle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the change between a large and no
inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the in-
ner core boundary and, if the core magnetic ﬁeld strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the ﬂuid and
solid cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational coupling be-
tween the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core
is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and the more the obliquity of the polar moment
of inertia approaches that expected for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar mo-
ment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007 ar-
cmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar mo-
ment of inertia should coincide at the present-day level of measurement errors, and cannot be
distinguished from the obliquity of a rigid planet.

Plain language summary: The plane of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun is slowly precess-
ing about an axis ﬁxed in space. This entrains a precession of the spin axis of Mercury at the
same rate, an equilibrium known as a Cassini state. The angle between the spin axis and the
normal to the orbital plane is known as the obliquity and remains ﬁxed. Observations have con-
ﬁrmed that Mercury’s obliquity matches, within measurement errors, the theoretical predic-
tion based on an entirely rigid planet. However, we know that Mercury has a large metallic core
which is liquid, although the central part may be solid. In this work, we investigate how the
presence of a ﬂuid and solid core aﬀect the Cassini state of Mercury. We show that the inter-
nal coupling between the solid core, ﬂuid core and the mantle is suﬃciently strong that the obliq-
uity of the mantle does not depart from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin, an
oﬀset smaller than the present-day error in measurements. We also show that the larger the
solid inner core is, the more the planet behaves as if it were precessing as an entirely rigid body.

1 Introduction

Mercury is expected to be in a Cassini state (Figure 1) whereby its orbit normal and spin-
symmetry axis are both coplanar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane [Colombo,
1966; Peale, 1969, 2006]. The orientation of the Laplace plane varies on long timescales, but
its present-day orientation can be reconstructed from ephemerides data [Yseboodt and Margot,
2006; Baland et al., 2017]. Likewise, the rate of precession is also not observed directly, but is
reconstructed by ephemerides data. The latest estimate is a retrograde precession period of 325,513
yr with an inclination angle of I = 8.5330◦ between the orbit and Laplace plane normals [Ba-
land et al., 2017]. Measurements of the obliquity εm, deﬁned as the angle of misalignment be-
tween the spin-symmetry axis and the orbit normal, have been obtained by diﬀerent techniques,
including ground based radar observations [Margot et al., 2007, 2012], and stereo digital ter-
rain images [Stark et al., 2015a] and radio tracking data [Mazarico et al., 2014; Verma and Mar-
got, 2016; Genova et al., 2019; Konopliv et al., 2020] from the MErcury Surface Space ENvi-
ronment GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. Within measurement errors,
all techniques yield an obliquity which is coplanar with the orbit and Laplace plane normals
and consistent with a Cassini state. Furthermore, the observed obliquity angle (2.042 ± 0.08

ova et al., 2019] to list a few) matches that expected if Mercury occupies Cassini state 1.

The prediction of Mercury’s obliquity is based on the assumption that the whole planet

precesses as a single body. However, we know that Mercury has a ﬂuid core from two main lines
of evidence. First, Mercury’s large scale magnetic ﬁeld is intrinsic, and must be maintained by
dynamo action [Anderson et al., 2011, 2012; Johnson et al., 2012]. This requires ﬂuid motion
in its metallic core, and hence that Mercury’s core is at least partially liquid. Second, the ob-
served amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal libration is approximately twice as large as that
expected if Mercury were librating as a rigid body [Margot et al., 2007, 2012; Stark et al., 2015a].
This indicates that it is only the mantle that librates, and that the outer part of the core is ﬂuid.
These evidences do not necessarily imply that the whole of Mercury’s core is ﬂuid, but only that
its outermost part must be. A solid inner core may have nucleated at the centre although its
size is not well constrained. Inner core growth leads to planetary contraction, and the inferred
radial contraction of ∼ 7 km since the late heavy bombardment [Byrne et al., 2014] places an
approximate limit of 800 km on the inner core radius [Grott et al., 2011]. However, the inner
core could be larger if a signiﬁcant fraction of its growth occurred earlier in Mercury’s history.

With a ﬂuid core, and possibly a solid inner core, the observed obliquity εm reﬂects the

orientation of the spin-symmetry axis of the precessing mantle and crust alone. Neglecting dis-
sipation, and at equilibrium in the Cassini state, the spin axis of the ﬂuid core and the spin-
symmetry axis of the inner core should both also precess about the normal to the Laplace plane
in a retrograde direction with a period of 325,513 yr. Both of these axes should also lie in the
plane that deﬁnes the equilibrium Cassini state [e.g. Dumberry and Wieczorek , 2016], although
their obliquity angles may be diﬀerent than εm. Whether the spin axis of the ﬂuid core is brought
into an alignment with the mantle obliquity depends primarily on the pressure torque (also re-
ferred to as the inertial torque) exerted by the centrifugal force of the rotating ﬂuid core on the
misaligned elliptical shape of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) [Poincar´e, 1910]. The more ﬂat-
tened the CMB is, the stronger the pressure torque is, and the more the ﬂuid core is entrained
into a co-precession at a similar obliquity to that of the mantle. The ﬂattening of Mercury’s
CMB is not known. But if one assumes that the topography of the CMB coincides with an equipo-
tential surface at hydrostatic equilibrium with the imposed frozen-in mass anomalies in the up-
per mantle and crust, then the pressure torque at the CMB is suﬃcient to bring the ﬂuid core
into a close alignment with the mantle [Peale et al., 2014]. The spin axis of the ﬂuid core is not
expected to be exactly aligned with the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle, but suﬃciently close
that the resulting mantle obliquity does not diﬀer much from that of a single body planet. Fur-
thermore, viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the CMB can further restrict the mis-
alignment between the mantle and core [Peale et al., 2014].

If an inner core is present, its obliquity angle is determined by the sum of the torques act-

ing on it. This includes the gravitational torque from the Sun acting on its tilted ﬁgure, anal-
ogous to the torque applied on the tilted mantle that sets the obliquity εm. In addition, the
tilt of the inner core also depends on the gravitational torque imposed by the mantle and the
pressure torque at the inner core boundary (ICB) imposed by the ﬂuid core. If the mantle grav-
itational torque dominates, the inner core tilt is expected to remain closely aligned with the
mantle. Conversely, if the pressure torque at the ICB is the largest, the inner core should in-
stead be closely aligned with the spin axis of the ﬂuid core. A strong viscous and/or EM cou-
pling at the ICB should also enforce a closer alignment between the rotation vectors of the in-
ner core and ﬂuid core.

It is on the basis of the observed mantle obliquity that the polar moment of inertia of Mer-

cury is inferred [e.g. Peale, 1976; Margot et al., 2018]. Inherent in this calculation is the built-
in assumption that the mantle obliquity does not deviate from that of a rigid planet by a sub-
stantial amount. However, the recent study by Peale et al. [2016] suggests that the inner core
can be misaligned from the mantle by a few arcmin and that a large inner core can perturb the
orientation of the spin vector of the mantle by as much as 0.1 arcmin. This challenges the as-
sumption that the observed obliquity reﬂects the orientation of the whole planet.

Furthermore, if a large inner core is misaligned with the mantle, then the mantle spin axis
does not coincide with the orientation of the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet. This
can introduce a systematic oﬀset between diﬀerent types of obliquity measurements. Those based
on tracking topographic features [Margot et al., 2007, 2012; Stark et al., 2015a] capture the obliq-
uity of the mantle spin axis. While those based on the orientation of the gravity ﬁeld [Mazarico
et al., 2014; Verma and Margot, 2016; Genova et al., 2019; Konopliv et al., 2020] are instead
tied to the orientation of the principal moment of inertia of the whole planet. An oﬀset of the
obliquity of the mantle spin axis with respect to the gravity ﬁeld could be used to constrain the
size of the inner core, even though this is diﬃcult to do at present because the diﬀerent esti-
mates of the obliquity of the gravity ﬁeld do not match well with one another.

There is thus a signiﬁcant interest in properly assessing how the presence of a solid in-

ner core at the centre of Mercury may aﬀect its Cassini state equilibrium. Here, we present a
model of Mercury’s Cassini state that comprises a ﬂuid core and solid inner core. The model
is an adaptation of a similar model developed to study the Cassini state of the Moon [Dumb-
erry and Wieczorek , 2016; Stys and Dumberry, 2018; Organowski and Dumberry, 2020]. The
speciﬁc questions that motivate our study are the following. First, we want to determine how
large the misaligned obliquities of the ﬂuid core and solid inner core can be and how they de-
pend on model parameters. Second, we want to assess by how much the mantle obliquity may
diﬀer from that of an entirely rigid Mercury, and third, by how much the obliquities of the spin-
symmetry axis of the mantle and gravity ﬁeld may diﬀer.

2 Theory

2.1 The interior structure of Mercury

Our model of Mercury consists of four layers of uniform density: a solid inner core, a ﬂuid
outer core, a solid mantle, and a thin crust. The outer radii of each of these layers, are denoted
by rs, rf , rm, and R, and their densities by ρs, ρf , ρm, and ρc, respectively. The inner core ra-
dius rs corresponds to the ICB radius, the ﬂuid core radius rf to the CMB radius, and R =
2439.36 km to the planetary radius of Mercury. Compressibility eﬀects from increasing pres-
sure with depth are not negligible in the core of Mercury. However adopting uniform densities
simpliﬁes the analytical expressions of the model while still capturing the ﬁrst order rotational
dynamics. Uniform densities were also adopted by Peale et al. [2016] and following the same
strategy facilitates comparisons between our results.

We build our interior model as detailed in Peale et al. [2016]. We ﬁrst specify rs, ρs (or
a density contrast at the ICB), the crustal density ρc and crustal thickness h = R−rm. The
three unknowns rf , ρf and ρm are then solved such that the interior model is consistent with
the known mass M and chosen values of the moments of inertia of the whole planet C and that
of the mantle and crust Cm.

Each layer is triaxial in shape. We denote the polar ﬂattening (or geometrical ellipticity)
by (cid:15)i, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the mean equatorial and polar radii, divided by the mean
spherical radius. Likewise, we denote the equatorial ﬂattening by the variable ξi, deﬁned as the
diﬀerence between the maximum and minimum equatorial radii, divided by the mean spher-
ical radius. As above, we use the subscript i = s, f , m and r, to denote the polar or equa-
torial ﬂattenings at the ICB, CMB, crust-mantle boundary (CrMB), and surface.

The measured polar and equatorial ﬂattenings are taken from Perry et al. [2015] and their
numerical values are given in Table 1. We then assume that the ICB and CMB are both at hy-
drostatic equilibrium with the imposed gravitational potential induced by the ﬂattenings at the
CrMB and surface. The ﬂattenings at all interior boundaries are speciﬁed such that they are
consistent with the observed degree 2 spherical harmonic coeﬃcients of gravity J2 and C22; their
numerical values are given in Table 1. Speciﬁcally, J2 and C22 are connected to the principal
moments of inertia of Mercury (C > B > A) and to the polar and equatorial ﬂattenings by

Note that we neglect the misalignment between the triaxial shape of Mercury’s surface topog-

2.2 The rotational model

Mercury’s rotation is characterized by a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance in which it completes

3 rotations around itself for every 2 orbital revolutions around the Sun. The orbital period is
87.96935 day and the sidereal rotation period is 58.64623 day [Stark et al., 2015b]. These de-
ﬁne the mean motion n = 2π/87.96935 day−1 and the sidereal frequency Ωo = 2π/58.64623
day−1, with Ωo = 1.5 n. Mercury’s rotational state is also characterized by a Cassini state whereby
the orientations of the orbit normal (ˆeI
nar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane (ˆeL
plane varies on long timescales, but it can be taken as invariable in inertial space for our present
purpose. The Cassini state of Mercury is illustrated in Figure 1. The angle between ˆeL
3 and ˆep
is the orbital inclination I = 8.5330◦ [Baland et al., 2017], the angle between ˆeI
obliquity εm and the angle between ˆeL
about the Laplace pole is retrograde with frequency Ωp = 2π/325, 513 yr−1 [Baland et al., 2017].

The mantle and crust are welded together and form a single rotating region which we re-
fer to as the ‘mantle’ in the context of our rotational model. The rotation and symmetry axes
of the mantle are expected to remain in close alignment, but they do not coincide exactly. We
deﬁne the rotation rate vector of the mantle by Ω, and its misalignment from ˆep
3 by an angle
θm. Note that θm (cid:28) εm and it is often the spin axis of Mercury which is used to deﬁne the
obliquity εm [e.g. Baland et al., 2017]. If Mercury were an entirely rigid planet, ˆep
characterize the symmetry and rotation axes of the whole of Mercury, not just its mantle, and
the angles I, εm and θm would completely describe the Cassini state. The presence of a ﬂuid
outer core and solid inner core require three additional orientation vectors and angles. The sym-
metry axis of the inner core is deﬁned by unit vector ˆes
3 by an
angle θn. The rotation vectors of the ﬂuid core and inner core are deﬁned as Ωf and Ωs, re-
spectively, and their misalignment from the rotation vector of the mantle Ω are deﬁned by an-
gles θf and θs (see Figure 2a). The rotation and symmetry axes of the inner core remain in close
alignment, so θn ≈ θs. To be formal in our deﬁnition of the diﬀerent angles of misalignment,
for I deﬁned positive as depicted on Figure 2a, all angles are deﬁned positive in the clockwise
direction.

At equilibrium in the Cassini state, the three orientation vectors (ˆeI

rotation vectors (Ω, Ωf , Ωs) are forced to precess about ˆeL
glect dissipation, all vectors lie on the same plane, which we refer to as the Cassini plane. Viewed
in inertial space, the Cassini plane is rotating in a retrograde direction at frequency Ωp. Viewed
in the frame attached to the mantle rotating at sidereal frequency Ωo, the Cassini plane is ro-
tating in a retrograde direction at frequency ωΩo (see Figure 2b), where ω, expressed in cycles
per Mercury day, is equal to

The factor δω = Ωp/Ωo = 4.933 × 10−7 is the Poincar´e number, expressing the ratio of the

as seen in the mantle frame is expressed as

This expresses a formal connection between θp and θm which is independent of the interior struc-
ture of Mercury. Using Equation (5) and cos(θm) → 1, this connection can be rewritten as

sin(θm) = δω sin(θp) .

(8)

and thus the relative amplitudes of θm and θp depend of the Poincar´e number δω.

To investigate Mercury’s response to the gravitational torque from the Sun, we take ad-
vantage of the framework developed in Mathews et al. [1991] to model the forced nutations of
Earth [see also Mathews et al., 2002; Dehant and Mathews, 2015]. This model takes into ac-
count the pressure torque (also referred to as the inertial torque) that results when the spin axis
of the ﬂuid core is misaligned from the symmetry axes of the elliptical surfaces of the CMB and
ICB. It also includes the gravitational torque exerted on the inner core when it is misaligned
with the mantle. Electromagnetic and viscous torques at both the CMB and ICB have been
incorporated into the framework [e.g Buﬀett, 1992; Buﬀett et al., 2002; Mathews and Guo, 2005;
Deleplace and Cardin, 2006]. The framework was adapted to model the Cassini state of the Moon
in Dumberry and Wieczorek [2016] and further developed in Stys and Dumberry [2018] and Organowski
and Dumberry [2020]. We adapt it here to capture the Cassini state of Mercury.

Because the forced precession period is much longer than the rotation and orbital peri-

ods of Mercury, the gravitational solar torque that is relevant to the Cassini state is the mean
torque averaged over one orbit. This mean torque is perpendicular to the Cassini plane, point-
ing in the same direction as the vector connecting the Sun to the descending node of Mercury’s
orbit in Figure 1. Hence, viewed from the mantle frame, the orientation of this mean torque
is periodic, rotating at frequency ωΩo. Setting the equatorial directions ˆep
to the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane, respectively, we can write the equatorial
components of this periodic applied torque in a compact form as

1 and ˆep

2 to correspond

Γ1(t) + iΓ2(t) = −i ˜Γ(ω) exp[iωΩot] ,
where ˜Γ(ω) represents the amplitude of the torque at frequency ωΩo. In response to this torque,
the axes deﬁning all angles (θp, εm, θm, θf , θs, θn) as viewed in the mantle frame are also ro-
tating at frequency ωΩo (see Figure 2). The longitudinal direction of each of these angles at
a speciﬁc time t can then also be written in the equatorial complex plane and is proportional
to exp[iωΩot]. For instance, the two equatorial time-dependent components θm1 and θm2 of the
angle θm, as seen in the mantle frame, can be written as

(9)

where

θm1(t) + iθm2(t) = ˜m exp[iωΩot] ,

is the amplitude at frequency ωΩo. Equivalent deﬁnitions apply for all other angles, with the
connection as follows:

θm ⇔ ˜m ,

θf ⇔ ˜mf ,

θn ⇔ ˜ns ,

The notation ˜m, ˜mf , ˜ms, ˜ns follows that introduced in the original model of Mathews et al. [1991].
Note that all tilded amplitudes are complex: their imaginary part reﬂects the out-of-phase re-
sponse to the applied torque as a result of dissipation, for instance from viscous or EM coupling

at the boundaries of the ﬂuid core. In the absence of dissipation, all tilded variables are purely
real. We concentrate our analysis in this work on the real part of the solutions, which corre-
sponds to the mutual alignment of these ﬁve rotation angles in the Cassini plane. As such, ˜εm
corresponds to the observed obliquity of the mantle symmetry axis. It is thus equivalent to εm,
though we keep the tilde notation in the presentation of our results to emphasize that it rep-
resents the real part of the solution from our system. Furthermore, since ˜m (cid:28) ˜εm, we often
refer to ˜εm as the orientation of spin axis of the mantle, since the Cassini state of Mercury is
more customarily described in terms of the latter in the literature.

The model of Mathews et al. [1991] is developed under the assumption of small angles as
appropriate for the nutations on Earth. The details on how the equations of the model are de-
rived can found in Mathews et al. [1991] and in Dumberry and Wieczorek [2016]. Three equa-
tions describe, respectively, the time rate of change of the angular momenta of the whole of Mer-
cury, the ﬂuid core, and the inner core in the reference frame of the rotating mantle. These three
equations are

Speciﬁc expressions for Kicb and Kcmb are delayed to sections 4 and 5 when we consider the

A ﬁfth equation is required to connect this interior model to the obliquity of the mantle,

and this is provided by Equation (7). For small angles θm and θp, this gives [e.g. Mathews et al.,
1991; Dumberry and Wieczorek , 2016; Baland et al., 2019]

˜m + (1 + ω)˜p = 0 .

(19)

For Mercury, it is more convenient to connect the internal model with ˜εm instead of ˜p. This
is because θp ≈ 8.567◦ whereas ˜εm ≈ 2 arcmin and thus the latter obeys more strictly the
condition of small angles assumed in our framework. Furthermore, the external torques act-
ing on the whole planet (Equation 14) and inner core (Equation 17) depend linearly on ˜εm. Writ-
ten in terms of ˜εm, and with the approximation of ˜εm (cid:28) 1 and ˜m (cid:28) 1, Equation (7) becomes

Likewise, the frequency ω from Equation (5) can be written simply in terms of I,

˜m + (1 + ω)˜εm = −(1 + ω) tan I .

ω = −1 − δω cos I .

The set of four Equations (12) with the addition of Equation (20) form a linear system
of equations for the ﬁve rotational variables ˜m, ˜mf , ˜ms, ˜ns and ˜εm. It captures the response
of Mercury, in the frequency domain, when subject to a periodic solar torque applied at fre-
quency ω. The system can be written in a matrix form as

Solutions of the homogeneous system (i.e. y = 0) represent free modes of precession. Three

modes have periods which, when seen in inertial space, are typically in the range of a few hun-
dred to a few thousand years. The ﬁrst is the free axial precession of Mercury maintained by
the solar torque acting on its elliptical ﬁgure [e.g. Peale, 2005]. The second is the free core nu-
tation (FCN), which is the free precession of the spin axis of the ﬂuid core about the symme-
try axis of the CMB [e.g. Mathews et al., 1991]. The third is the free inner core nutation (FICN),
a free mode of rotation similar to the FCN but associated with the inner core [e.g. Mathews et al.,
1991].

A few remarks on our model are important to point out before we proceed further. First,

although we have retained the triaxial shape of Mercury in the expression of the solar torque,
we treat its angular momentum response as if it were an axially symmetric body. This is con-
venient as the two equatorial angular momentum equations for each region can be combined
into a single equation. To ﬁrst order, the frequency of the free precession of Mercury is not largely
altered by triaxiality [e.g. Peale, 2005]. Baland et al. [2019] showed that the frequencies of the
FCN and FICN for a triaxial planetary body may be slightly diﬀerent than those for an axi-
ally symmetric body, but not by large factor. As the response of Mercury to the solar torque
is largely determined by the resonant ampliﬁcation due to the presence of these three modes,
our model should capture correctly the ﬁrst order Cassini state of Mercury. Considering the
triaxial shape of Mercury may alter the numerical results, but not our general conclusions.

Second, our modelling approach is diﬀerent than in the studies of Peale et al. [2014] and
Peale et al. [2016]. In these two studies, dynamical models of Mercury’s Cassini state are de-
veloped and must then be integrated in time. The equilibrium Cassini state is the quasi-steady
state that remains after transient eﬀects associated with the initial conditions have decayed away.
An advantage of these models compared to ours is that the complete triaxial dynamics of Mer-
cury, including its longitudinal librations, are retained. However, the numerical integration can
be lengthy if dissipation is weak, which restricts the number of possible interior models of Mer-
cury that can be tested. In contrast, our model is a simple linear system in the frequency do-
main, focused on one speciﬁc frequency: the forced precession associated with the Cassini state.
Solutions are straightforward to obtain for a given interior model, and this allows us to cover
a larger span of the parameter space. One drawback, however, is that our model does not cap-
ture time-dependent variations at any other frequencies, including the precession of the peri-
center of Mercury’s orbit about the Sun.

2.3 Analytical solutions and limiting cases

2.3.1 The Cassini state of a single-body, rigid Mercury

For a rigid planet with no ﬂuid and solid cores, our system of equations reduces to Equa-

tions (12a) and (20),

(ω − e) ˜m + φm ˜εm = 0 ,
˜m + (1 + ω)˜εm = −(1 + ω) tan I .

Using Equation (21), δω (cid:28) 1, and the approximation ¯A(1 + e + δω cos I) = C + ¯Aδω cos I ≈
C, these can be written as

C ˜m = ¯Aφm ˜εm ,
˜m = δω(cid:0) sin I + cos I ˜εm

(cid:1) .

(23a)

(23b)

(24a)

(24b)

Equation (24b) gives a direct relationship between ˜m and ˜εm. For I = 8.5330◦, δω =
4.9327×10−7 and taking ˜εm = 2.04 arcmin, this gives ˜m = 2.52×10−4 arcmin, much smaller
than ˜εm: the oﬀset of the rotation axis of the mantle with respect to its symmetry axis is very
small. Substituting Equation (24b) in Equation (24a) gives

and isolating for ˜εm,

CΩp

(cid:0) sin I + cos I ˜εm

(cid:1) = ¯AΩoφm ˜εm ,

˜εm =

CΩp sin I
−CΩp cos I + ¯AΩoφm

.

Upon using Equations (4), (15a), and Ωo = 3

2 n, we can write

˜εm =

CΩp sin I
−CΩp cos I + nM R2 (G210J2 + 2G201C22)

.

(25)

(26)

(27)

This is the standard prediction for the obliquity of a rigid Mercury occupying Cassini state 1
[see for instance Equation (1) of Baland et al., 2017, where their deﬁnition of ˙Ω is equal to −Ωp].
Hence, in the absence of a ﬂuid core and inner core, our system retrieves the Cassini state of
Mercury correctly. Equation (27) can be manipulated to solve instead for the normalized mo-
ment of inertia ˆC,

ˆC =

C
M R2 =

n
Ωp

G210J2 + 2G201C22
cos I + sin I/˜εm

.

(28)

which is equivalent to Equation (89) of Van Hoolst [2015]. It is based on the latter equation
that a measurement of the obliquity gives a constraint on ˆC.

Two free modes of precession are found by setting y = 0 in Equation (23). One mode cor-

responds to the Eulerian wobble, or Chandler wobble, and represents the prograde precession
of the rotation axis about the symmetry axis. The second mode is the free retrograde axial pre-
cession of Mercury. As seen in the inertial frame, its frequency is given by

(29)

which is equivalent to the prediction by Peale [2005] when neglecting its small elliptical com-
ponent. Note that in Peale [2005] it was assumed that only the mantle was involved in the solid-
body precession and hence C was replaced by Cm. Using C = 0.346 · M R2 [Margot et al.,
2012] and the numerical values for n, J2, C22 and ec given in Table 1, we obtain a free preces-
sion period of Tf p = 2π/ωf p = 1298 yr. If we use Cm instead of C in Equation (29), and take
Cm = 0.431 · C = 0.431 · 0.346 · M R2 [Margot et al., 2012], we obtain Tf p = 2π/ωf p = 560 yr.
These estimates are similar to those obtained by Peale [2005]. Because the CMB is elliptical,
the pressure torque exerted on the ﬂuid core by the mantle leads to an entrainment of the ﬂuid
core, the degree of which depends on the amplitude of the pole-to-equator CMB ﬂattening. The
true free precession period lies somewhere between 560 and 1298 yr. Regardless of its exact value,
the free precession period is much shorter than the forcing period of 325 kyr. Using Equation
(29), Equation (27) can be written as [e.g. Baland et al., 2017]

˜εm =

Ωp sin I
−Ωp cos I + ωf p

.

(30)

The obliquity of Mercury is thus determined by how the forcing frequency Ωp compares with
the free precession frequency ωf p. Because ωf p > Ωp, Mercury occupies Cassini state 1 [Peale,
1974]. Furthermore, Equation (30) shows that a large obliquity can be generated by resonant
ampliﬁcation if Ωp ≈ ωf p. Since ωf p (cid:29) Ωp, resonant ampliﬁcation is minimal and the re-
sulting obliquity, ˜εm ≈ 2 arcmin, is much smaller than the inclination angle I ≈ 8.5◦.

2.3.2 The misalignment of the ﬂuid and solid cores

With ω = −1 − δω cos I and δω (cid:28) 1, Equation (12d) gives ˜ns ≈ ˜ms; as for the mantle,
the rotation and symmetry axes of the inner core remain closely aligned in the Cassini state.
The relationship between ˜m and ˜εm of Equation (24b) is independent of the interior structure,
so it remains unchanged when a ﬂuid and a solid cores are present. Substituting it in Equa-
tion (12a), and setting ˜ns = ˜ms, the angular momentum equation of the whole planet becomes

CΩp

(cid:0) sin I + cos I ˜εm

(cid:1) + ( ¯Af cos I Ωp) ˜mf + ¯As(cos I Ωp − Ωoα3φs)˜ns = ¯AΩoφm ˜εm .

(31)

This latter equation shows how the misaligned inner core and ﬂuid core can lead to a modiﬁ-
cation of the mantle obliquity ˜εm. Approximate analytical solutions of ˜ns and ˜mf are given by

These solutions are good approximations for all the results that we present in section 3. For
an observed mantle obliquity ˜εm and for a chosen set of interior model parameters, they pro-
vide useful predictions of ˜ns and ˜mf .

In the limit of a very strong coupling between the ﬂuid core, solid core and mantle, ¯σs (cid:29)

Ωp and ¯σf (cid:29) Ωp, so that ˜ns → 0, ˜mf → 0 and Equation (31) reverts back to Equation (25)
for a rigid planet. In the opposite limit of no coupling between the ﬂuid core, solid core and
mantle (i.e. for spherical internal boundaries, ef = es = γs = 0 and no viscous or EM cou-
pling, Kcmb = Kicb = 0), then

φs = 0 ,

κ = 1 ,

λf = λs = −Ωp cos I ,

˜mf = ˜ns = −(tan I + ˜εm) .

(34)

Inserting these in Equation (31), and with the moment of inertia of the mantle equal to Cm =
C − ¯Af − ¯As, we obtain

Cm Ωp

(cid:0) sin I + cos I ˜εm

(cid:1) = ¯AΩoφm ˜εm .

(35)

which describes, as expected, a forced precession of the mantle alone. If this was the case for
Mercury, taking Cm/C = 0.431, the obliquity should be ˜εm ≈ 0.88 arcmin, substantially smaller
than the observed obliquity of ˜εm ≈ 2 arcmin.

If ¯σf ≈ Ωp (and thus λf → 0) and/or ¯σs ≈ Ωp (and thus λs → 0) resonant ampliﬁca-

tion leads to large amplitudes for ˜mf , ˜ns and the mantle obliquity ˜εm. The frequencies ¯σf and
¯σs are closely related to the FCN and FICN frequencies ωf cn and ωf icn, respectively. Hence,
just as a large mantle obliquity can result from resonant ampliﬁcation when the forcing frequency
approaches the free precession frequency, a large mantle obliquity can likewise result from res-
onant ampliﬁcation when the forcing frequency approaches the FCN or FICN frequencies. These
frequencies depend on the interior density structure and are not known. However, we will show
that for reasonable interior models of Mercury, the FCN and FICN periods are in the range of
a few hundred yr. This is suﬃciently far from the forcing period (325 kyr) that we do not ex-
pect an important ampliﬁcation eﬀect. Furthermore, since ωf cn, ωf icn (cid:29) Ωp, then ¯σf (cid:29) Ωp
and ¯σs (cid:29) Ωp, and we are in the strong coupling limit. The mantle obliquity should be close
to that expected for a rigid planet, as observations suggest. Therefore, we expect that ˜mf and
˜ns should be of the order of ˜εm or smaller. This further justiﬁes the assumption of small an-
gles that we have adopted.

3 Results

3.1 Geodetic constraints and interior density structure

All our interior models are constrained to match the mass M of Mercury and speciﬁc choices

of ˆC = C/M R2 and Cm/C. The choice of ˆC is determined from Equation (28). For the pa-
rameters listed in Table 1, and an observed obliquity of εm = 2.04 arcmin [Margot et al., 2012],
this gives ˆC = C/M R2 = 0.3455 and all our interior models are consistent with this choice.
Obviously, this reﬂects a Cassini state equilibrium in which the ﬂuid core and inner core are

–15–

perfectly aligned with the mantle, which is not strictly correct. Hence, we make an error in es-
timating ˆC from Equation (28), or conversely in predicting εm based on a given choice for ˆC.
Part of the objective of our study is to estimate how large this error is. The ratio Cm/C is ob-
tained from the amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal mantle libration φo, which is given by

and where ζ is a correction that takes into account the entrainment of the inner core in the li-
bration [Van Hoolst et al., 2012; Dumberry et al., 2013; Dumberry and Rivoldini , 2015]; this cor-
rection is small and, to simplify, we neglect it here. Taking the observed libration amplitude
to be 38.5 arcsec [Margot et al., 2012], ˆC = C/M R2 = 0.3455 and C22 and ec from Table 1,
this corresponds to a ratio Cm/C = 0.4269, or equivalently ˆCm = Cm/M R2 = 0.1475.

For all results presented in our study, the crustal density is set at ρc = 2974 kg m−3 [Sori ,

2018]. Our standard choice for the crustal thickness is h = 26 km [Sori , 2018], although in
section 3.2 we also present some results with other choices of h. We have considered two pos-
sible prescriptions connected to the density of the inner core. First, for all the results presented
in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, we have used a ﬁxed inner core density of ρs = 8800 kg m−3 ap-
proximately that obtained in Dumberry and Rivoldini [2015] under the assumption of a pure
Fe composition in face-centered cubic phase. This captures an end-member scenario where the
core composition is an Fe-S alloy; at Mercury’s core conditions, crystallization of Fe is relatively
free of S on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic [Li et al., 2001]. If the core composition is instead
an Fe-Si alloy, approximately equal partitioning of Si between the liquid and solid phase [e.g.
Schaefer et al., 2017] implies a weak chemical contrast at the ICB. The density jump across the
ICB is expected to be small, although since density increases with depth, the contrast between
the mean densities of the ﬂuid and solid cores is larger. It is these mean densities that enter
our Mercury model with uniform density layers. To capture this other end-member core com-
position scenario, in section 3.5 we present results where we instead prescribe a ﬁxed density
contrast between the ﬂuid and solid core; speciﬁcally, we set the numerical value of α3.

For a given choice of inner core radius rs, the densities of the mantle (ρm) and ﬂuid core
(ρf ) and the radius of the CMB (rf ) are determined such that the interior model matches M ,
ˆC = 0.3455 and ˆCm = 0.1475. Figure 3a shows how ρm, ρf and rf vary as a function of in-
ner core radius rs for each of the two inner core density scenarios: a ﬁxed ρs, or a ﬁxed α3. When
the inner core is small, its presence has a limited inﬂuence on the resulting density structure,
and we ﬁnd ρm = 3197 kg m−3, ρf = 7263 kg m−3 and rf = 2000 km in each of the two
scenarios. When ρs is ﬁxed to 8800 kg m−3, as the inner core reaches 1500 km in size, rf in-
creases to above 2100 km, ρm approaches 4000 kg m−3 and ρf is reduced to below 5000 kg m−3.
Figure 3a illustrates that when adopting a ﬁxed ρs, there is a limit in the possible inner core
size, as otherwise ρm gets unreasonably large and ρf gets inappropriately small (as it would
require an excessively large concentration of light elements). When adopting instead a ﬁxed den-
sity contrast, with α3 = 0.1, the changes in rf , ρm and ρf with inner core radius are more mod-
est, allowing larger possible inner core sizes. Diﬀerent assumptions on ρc and h would alter the
numerical values shown on Figure 3a but not their trends with rs.

Figure 3b shows how the FCN and FICN periods vary with rs for each of the two inner
core density scenarios and in the absence of viscous and EM coupling (i.e. Kcmb = Kicb =

ner core, increasing to approximately 600 yr at the largest rs. The FICN period is shorter, close
to 100 yr (160 yr) for a small inner core and decreasing to approximately 40 yr (120 yr) at the
largest rs under the ﬁxed ρs (ﬁxed α3) scenario. This conﬁrms that the FCN and FICN peri-
ods are both much shorter than the forcing precession period of 325 kyr and suﬃciently far away
from it that we do not expect large ˜mf and ˜ns from resonant ampliﬁcation.

The FCN and FICN periods that we have computed include the inﬂuence of the exter-
nal torque. As shown by Baland et al. [2019], the external torque allow solid regions to have
a free motion in inertial space thereby aﬀecting the free rotational modes. To a good approx-
imation, the FCN and FICN frequencies (as seen in an inertial frame) for Kcmb = Kicb = 0
are given by

The expression of the FICN frequency involves the inertial torque (term esα1) and the grav-
itational torque from the rest of Mercury (esα3αg) and the Sun (α3φs) acting on the inner core.
For both of our inner core density scenarios (and our choices of ρs = 8800 kg m−3 and α3 =
0.1), the internal gravitational torque dominates that from the Sun. Furthermore, α3αg (cid:29) α1;
the gravitational torque dominates the inertial torque, in large part because of the slow rota-
tion rate of Mercury. As a result the FICN frequency is negative (i.e. the precession motion
is retrograde). This is also the case for the Moon [e.g. Dumberry and Wieczorek , 2016; Stys and
Dumberry, 2018], but it is diﬀerent for Earth, where α1 > α3αg because of its faster rotation
and the FICN mode is prograde [Mathews et al., 1991]. Note also that our approximate expres-

sion for the FICN diﬀers by a factor ( ¯A+ ¯As)/( ¯A− ¯As) compared to that given in Dumberry
and Wieczorek [2016] and Stys and Dumberry [2018] for the Moon.

The expression for FCN frequency diﬀers from the usual expression for Earth. First, it
involves the external torque from the Sun captured by the parameter φm. If we set φm = 0,
we obtain the FCN frequency for a decoupled model in which only interior torques contribute,

(38c)

This frequency is slightly diﬀerent from the usual expression for Earth, involving the ratio ¯A/( ¯Am+
¯As) rather than ¯A/ ¯Am. This is because of the relatively thin mantle of Mercury; for the largest
rs considered, the moment of inertia of the inner core can get close to 40% of that of the man-
tle and is not negligible. The period of the FCN when only interior torques contribute is shown
in Figure 3b. It is close to 1100 yr for a small inner core, increasing to approximately 1500 yr
at the largest rs. Hence, the inﬂuence of the solar torque reduces the FCN period by a factor
of approximately 3. We note that the FICN period, in contrast, is not altered substantially when
the external torque is set to zero.

3.2 Gravitational and inertial coupling

Let us now investigate the obliquities of the mantle, ﬂuid core and inner core in their equi-

librium Cassini state. We assume a ﬁxed inner core density scenario in this section, with ρs =
8800 kg m−3. Viscous and EM coupling are set to zero in order to isolate the inﬂuence of grav-
itational and inertial coupling. Figure 4 shows how ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns vary as functions of inner
core radius. We show calculations for three diﬀerent choices of crustal thickness, but let us con-
centrate ﬁrst on the case for h = 26 km. For small rs, we retrieve an obliquity of ˜εm = 2.0494
arcmin (Figure 4a). ˜εm decreases with rs, but not substantially; at the largest rs (1500 km),
˜εm = 2.0460 arcmin, a decrease of 0.0034 arcmin. The maximum diﬀerence from ˜εm = 2.04
arcmin, the obliquity that we used in setting the constraint for ˆC – and hence the prediction
we should recover for a rigid planet – is an overestimate of approximately 0.01 arcmin which
occurs for small inner cores.

The deviation of ˜εm from that of a rigid planet is due to the misalignments of the ﬂuid

core ( ˜mf ) and solid inner core (˜ns) with respect to the mantle (Figure 4b). The misalignment
of the ﬂuid core spin axis from the mantle is signiﬁcant: ˜mf is approximately 4.02 arcmin for
a small inner core and does not vary substantially with inner core size; it drops to 3.97 arcmin
at the largest rs. Recall that ˜mf is measured with respect to the mantle rotation axis (which
coincides closely with the symmetry axis), so the obliquity of the spin axis of the ﬂuid core with
respect to the orbit normal is ˜εm+ ˜mf ≈ 6 arcmin. The reason why the obliquity of the spin
axis of the ﬂuid core is larger than that of the mantle can be understood from Equation (32b),
which shows that ˜mf is determined by the resonant ampliﬁcation of the FCN mode at the forc-
ing frequency. When the FCN frequency is much larger than the forcing frequency, as is the
case for Mercury, the resonant ampliﬁcation is very weak but remains present and ˜mf is larger
than zero.

In contrast to ˜mf , the misalignment of the inner core with respect to the mantle is much

smaller; ˜ns is approximately between 0.023-0.025 arcmin, a factor 80 times smaller than ˜εm.
Physically, this is because the gravitational torque acting on the inner core when it is tilted from
the mantle is much stronger than the inertial torque acting at the ICB. As a result, the inner
core must remain in close alignment with the mantle. Presented diﬀerently, since the FICN pe-
riod is more than 3000 times shorter than the forced precession period, the inner core can eas-

ily follow the forced precession of the mantle and remains gravitationally locked to it. ˜ns does
not change substantially as the inner core increases in size.

When Kicb = Kcmb = 0, a good approximation of ˜εm is given by

˜εm =

(39)

which is identical to the prediction of Equation (26) for a rigid Mercury, except C is replaced
by C (cid:48). The latter represents an eﬀective moment of inertia that accounts for the coupling of
the core to the mantle,

where ¯Ac = ¯Af + ¯As and

The frequencies ¯σf and ¯σs are given in Equations (33d-33e) and closely approximate the FCN
and FICN frequencies of Equations (38c) and (38b), respectively. The factor χ captures then
how the core is entrained to precess with the mantle, with the coupling between the two ex-
pressed in terms of the resonant ampliﬁcation of the FCN and FICN frequencies. In the limit
of ¯σf , ¯σs → 0, then χ = −1, C (cid:48) = Cm, the core is fully decoupled from the mantle and we
retrieve Equation (35). If instead ¯σf , ¯σs → ∞, then χ = 0, C (cid:48) = C and we retrieve the pre-
diction for a rigid planet. When both the FCN and FICN frequencies are much larger than Ωp,
as is the case here, resonant ampliﬁcation is weak, χ is small and positive, C (cid:48) > C and this
leads to a slightly larger ˜εm compared to a rigid planet. Because the inner core core is grav-
itationally locked to the mantle, deviations from a rigid planet are dominantly caused by the
misalignment of the ﬂuid core. In Equation (41), ¯σs (cid:29) ¯σf , so to a good approximation

For a small inner core, χ ≈ 7.55×10−3. As the inner core grows, ¯Af decreases, and the com-
bination ¯Acχ also decreases. This implies that C (cid:48) decreases with inner core size and, consequently,
˜εm also decreases with inner core size, as seen in Figure 4a, though it remains larger than the
prediction for a rigid planet.

The speciﬁc predictions of ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns on Figure 4 depend sensitively on the assumed

interior density model and on the dynamical ellipticities of the inner core (es) and ﬂuid core
(ef ). Hence, it depends on the choices we have made for the inner core density ρs, the crustal
density ρc and its thickness h. Changing ρs, ρc and/or h requires a diﬀerent combination of ρf ,
ρm and rf in order to match M , ˆC and ˆCm. In turn, this leads to diﬀerent ellipticities at in-
terior boundary in order to match J2 and C22, and thus diﬀerent predictions for ˜εm, ˜mf and
˜ns. To illustrate this, we show on Figure 4 two additional predictions computed with crustal
thicknesses changed to h = 16 and 36 km. The change in ˜εm remains modest, ∼ 0.025%, but
the changes in ˜mf and ˜ns are more substantial, ∼ 5% and ∼ 10%, respectively.

We also show on Figure 4a (only for h = 26 km) the obliquity of the principal moment
of inertia of the whole planet, which we denote by ˜εg. A diﬀerence between ˜εg and ˜εm occurs
if the inner core is misaligned with the mantle. As seen in the mantle frame, a tilted inner core
(with ˜ns assumed small) leads to an oﬀ-diagonal component of the moment of inertia tensor
of (Cs− ¯As)α3 ˜ns = ¯Asesα3 ˜ns. The angle by which the mantle frame must be rotated so that
the moment of inertia of the whole planet is purely diagonal is ( ¯Asesα3 ˜ns)/( ¯Ae), and hence a
good approximation of ˜εg is

˜εg = ˜εm +

¯Ases
¯Ae

α3 ˜ns .

(43)

Since the inner core is gravitationally forced into a close alignment with the mantle, the dif-
ference between ˜εg and ˜εm remains very small. For the largest inner core radius that we have
considered, ˜εg diﬀers from ˜εm only by approximately 0.001 arcmin.

3.3 Viscous coupling

We now investigate how viscous coupling at the CMB and ICB aﬀects the equilibrium Cassini

state. Peale et al. [2014] present two diﬀerent parameterizations of viscous coupling based on
the timescale of attenuation of the diﬀerential rotation between the ﬂuid core and mantle. More
complete analytical solutions for the ﬂow resulting from a diﬀerentially precessing shell have
been derived [e.g. Stewartson and Roberts, 1963; Busse, 1968; Rochester , 1976] and we exploit
these solutions here. The parametrization of the viscous coupling constants Kcmb and Kicb based
on them are given in Mathews and Guo [2005],

where ν is the kinematic viscosity. The appropriate numerical value for ν in planetary inte-
rior is not well known but based on theoretical and experimental studies it is expected to be
of the order of 10−6 m2 s−1 [e.g. Gans, 1972; de Wijs et al., 1998; Alf`e et al., 2000; Rutter et al.,
2002a,b].

The above parameterizations are valid only under the assumption that the ﬂow in the bound-

ary layer remains laminar. Whether this is reasonable can be assessed by evaluating the Reynolds
number Re = rf ∆uf /ν, associated with the diﬀerential velocity ∆uf = rf Ωo ˜mf at the CMB.
For rf = 2000 km, and taking ˜mf = 4 arcmin ≈ 0.001 rad from the results in the previous
section, we get ∆uf ∼ 2 mm/s and Re ∼ 6 × 109. Such a large Reynolds number indicates
that the viscous friction between the ﬂuid core and mantle should induce turbulent ﬂows, as
is the case for the Cassini state of the Moon [Yoder , 1981; Williams et al., 2001; C´ebron et al.,
2019]. For a boundary layer that involves turbulent ﬂows, the viscous torque should be inde-
pendent of the ﬂuid viscosity and proportional to the square of the diﬀerential velocity. The
coupling constant Kcmb should be in the form

Kcmb = fcmb

where fcmb is a numerical factor that depends among other things on surface roughness. In-
corporating a viscous coupling of this form in our rotational model is more challenging not only
because fcmb is not known but also because the viscous torque is no longer linear in ˜mf . One
strategy is to ﬁnd solutions through an iterative process. The simpler alternative strategy that
we adopt is to use the laminar formulas of Equation (44) but with the understanding that ν
represents an eﬀective turbulent viscosity.

To give an estimate of an appropriate turbulent value for ν, we turn to the Cassini state
of the Moon. A measure of the viscous dissipation at the CMB of the Moon has been obtained
by ﬁtting a rotation model to the librations of the Moon observed by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)
[Williams et al., 2001, 2014; Williams and Boggs, 2015]. Viscous dissipation is reported in terms
of a coupling parameter K and a recent estimate is K/CL = (1.41±0.34)×10−8 day−1 [Williams
and Boggs, 2015], where CL is the lunar polar moment of inertia. The connection between K
and Kcmb is

where Cf L is the moment of inertia of the lunar core and ΩL = 2.66 × 10−6 s−1 the lunar
rotation rate. With Cf L/CL ∼ 7 × 10−4 [e.g. Williams et al., 2014], this gives |Im[Kcmb]| ∼
9×10−5. In order to match this amplitude in Equation (44a), with lunar parameters and as-
suming a lunar core radius of 400 km, the required turbulent viscosity is ν ≈ 5 × 10−4 m2
s−1, about 500 times larger than the laminar viscosity. Note that the diﬀerential velocity at the
CMB of the Moon is closer to 3 cm/s [Yoder , 1981; Williams et al., 2001], more than 10 times
larger than our estimate for Mercury above. Since the eﬀective turbulent coupling constant Kcmb
is proportional to the diﬀerential velocity, the eﬀective turbulent viscosity appropriate for Mer-
cury should be smaller. Thus, ν ≈ 5×10−4 m2 s−1 gives a conservative upper bound for the
possible eﬀective turbulent viscosity that can be expected for Mercury.

Figure 5 shows how ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns vary as functions of inner core radius for diﬀerent choices

of eﬀective viscosities. For ν = 10−5 m2 s−1, viscous coupling is too weak to aﬀect ˜εm and
˜mf and they are essentially unchanged from the solutions shown in Figure 4. With increasing
ν, the stronger viscous coupling between the core and the mantle reduces their diﬀerential ve-
locity, and ˜mf is reduced. With the reduced diﬀerential velocity at the CMB, the prediction
of ˜εm gets closer to 2.04 arcmin, the obliquity expected for a rigid planet. Although our CMB
viscous coupling model is diﬀerent than the one used by Peale et al. [2014], our results for ˜εm
and ˜mf are qualitatively similar: viscous coupling at the CMB acts to reduce the oﬀset of the
ﬂuid spin axis from the mantle symmetry axis. Considering the upper bound in turbulent vis-
cosity that we have identiﬁed above (i.e ν ≈ 5 × 10−4 m2 s−1), the inﬂuence of viscous cou-

viscosity (color in legend).

pling on ˜εm remains modest, reducing its amplitude by a maximum of approximately 0.0015
arcmin.

The inclusion of viscous coupling at the ICB can lead to a substantial change in inner core

tilt. A larger viscosity leads to stronger viscous coupling and to a closer alignment of the in-
ner core with the ﬂuid core spin axis. The viscous coupling strength is inversely proportional
to rs, so a larger viscosity results in a larger inner core radius at which viscous coupling is of
a similar magnitude to gravitational coupling. Taking again an upper bound of ν = 5×10−4
m2 s−1, Figure 5 indicates that ˜ns may be 1 arcmin or larger only if the inner core radius is
smaller than approximately 100 km. For an inner core of a few hundred km in radius, gravi-
tational coupling is much larger than viscous coupling, and the inner core tilt is limited to a
fraction of 1 arcmin.

The larger inner core tilt observed with increasing eﬀective viscosity results in a larger
oﬀset between the obliquity of the principal moment of inertia ˜εg and that of the mantle ˜εm,
though it remains limited. For the upper bound of ν = 5 × 10−4 m2 s−1, and for rs = 1500
km, the diﬀerence between ˜εg and ˜εm is limited to 0.0013 arcmin.

The conclusion that emerges from Figure 5 is that the larger the inner core is, the smaller

the misalignments of both the ﬂuid core and inner core are with respect to the mantle. This
implies that the larger the inner core is, the more we approach a planet precessing as a rigid
body, although the misalignment of the spin axis of the ﬂuid core remains important, approx-
imately 3-4 arcmin away from the mantle symmetry axis. The speciﬁc way in which ˜εm, ˜mf
and ˜ns change with inner core size would certainly be diﬀerent for a turbulent model of viscous
coupling. But the general conclusion remains that the addition of viscous coupling at the CMB
and ICB does not signiﬁcantly modify the Cassini state equilibrium angle of the mantle.

3.4 Electromagnetic coupling

Let us now turn to electromagnetic (EM) coupling. To focus on its role in the equilibrium
Cassini state, we set the viscous coupling back to zero. Because magnetic ﬁeld lines tend to re-
main attached to electrically conducting materials, a diﬀerential tangential motion between two
electrically conducting regions stretches existing magnetic ﬁeld lines that thread their interface.
This induces a secondary magnetic ﬁeld (or equivalently, an electrical current) and an associ-
ated tangential EM stress resisting the diﬀerential motion. EM coupling at the CMB and ICB
acts then in a similar way to viscous coupling, and this ’magnetic friction’ depends on the strength
of the radial magnetic ﬁeld Br and the electrical conductivity σ on either side of the bound-
ary [Rochester , 1960, 1962, 1968].

The parametrization of EM coupling in terms of the coupling constants Kcmb and Kicb
has been developed in a few studies [e.g. Buﬀett, 1992; Buﬀett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot,
2012]. Assuming a dominating axial dipole ﬁeld, with a radial component at the CMB given
(cid:11) is the r.m.s. strength of the ﬁeld, the coupling constant

We can readily build an estimate of the amplitude of Kcmb. The electrical conductivity
of common mantle minerals in Earth’s mantle at the pressure and temperature corresponding
to the CMB of Mercury is in the range of σm ∼ 0.01 − 1 S m−1 [Constable, 2015]. In con-
trast, the electrical conductivity of Fe in planetary cores is expected to be close σf ∼ 106 S
m−1 [Pozzo et al., 2012; de Koker et al., 2012]. This implies that (σmδm)−1 (cid:29) (σf δf )−1. Tak-
(cid:12)
ing σm = 1 S m−1, (cid:12)
(cid:12) = 190 nT for Mercury’s dipole ﬁeld [Anderson et al., 2012], rf =
2000 km, ρf = 7000 kg m−3, this gives Kcmb ≈ (3.1 × 10−11) · (1 − i). To put this amplitude
in perspective, taking a molecular viscosity of ν = 10−6 m2 s−1 in Equation (44a) gives a vis-
cous coupling constant of Kcmb ≈ (6.0 × 10−7) · (0.195 − 1.976i). Hence, EM coupling at the
CMB is much weaker than viscous coupling, even if we include other spherical harmonic com-
ponents of the radial magnetic ﬁeld.

(cid:12)g0

EM coupling can be enhanced if strongly stratiﬁed pockets of core ﬂuid are trapped by

CMB cavities [Buﬀett, 2010; Glane and Buﬀett, 2018], in which case the eﬀective σm could be
closer to σf . Likewise, σm can be increased if a more electrically conducting layer has formed
at the bottom of Mercury’s mantle, for instance by the upward sedimentation and compaction
of solid FeS crystals precipitating out of the ﬂuid core [e.g. Hauck et al., 2013]. However, even
in the extreme case of σm = σf = 106 S m−1, Kcmb ≈ (1.6 × 10−8) · (1 − i), which remains

–23–

Conﬁdential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets

smaller by a factor ∼ 60 than the smallest possible viscous coupling constant. Viscous forces
dominate the tangential stress on the CMB of Mercury.

At the ICB, because we can expect the electrical conductivity in both the solid inner core

and ﬂuid core to be similar, and because the radial magnetic ﬁeld is likely much stronger, EM
coupling can be much larger and dominate viscous coupling. We assume that the magnetic ﬁeld
morphology at the ICB is dominantly comprised of small spatial scales for example as predicted
by the dynamo model of Christensen [2006]. EM coupling in this case can be parametrized in
terms of an equivalent uniform radial magnetic ﬁeld (cid:104)Br(cid:105) capturing its r.m.s. strength [Buf-
fett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot, 2012]. Assuming an electrical conductivity σ equal in the
ﬂuid and solid core, the coupling constant Kicb can be written in the form

where

Ficb =

σδ
Ωoρsrs

,

(50)

(51)

and where δ = (cid:112)2/(σµΩo) is the magnetic skin depth. As Ficb is inversely proportional to
rs, Kicb is inversely proportional to inner core size. Note that computing the EM coupling based
on the r.m.s. strength (cid:104)Br(cid:105) rather than a true ﬁeld morphology tends to overestimate the strength
of the coupling [Koot and Dumberry, 2013]. However, since the strength of the radial magnetic
ﬁeld at the ICB of Mercury is largely unknown, imperfections of the EM coupling model are
absorbed in the range of possible (cid:104)Br(cid:105) values.

The parametrization of Equation (50) is only valid in a ’weak ﬁeld’ regime [Buﬀett et al.,
2002], when the feedback from the Lorentz force on the ﬂow in the ﬂuid core can be neglected.
When (cid:104)Br(cid:105) is suﬃciently large, this is no longer the case. EM coupling then enters a ’strong
ﬁeld’ regime [Buﬀett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot, 2012; Koot and Dumberry, 2013] in which
Kicb increases linearly with (cid:104)Br(cid:105) instead of quadratically. A good approximation of Kicb cal-
culated for Earth can be extracted from Figure 6a of Dumberry and Koot [2012],

To compute Ficb, we assume an electrical conductivity of σ = 106 S m−1 in the core of
Mercury [e.g. de Koker et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2013]. The transition between the weak and
strong ﬁeld regime occurs when (cid:104)Br(cid:105) ≈ 1.53 mT for the real part of Kicb. (cid:104)Br(cid:105) at the ICB
of Mercury is unknown. The dynamo model of Christensen [2006] showed that the ﬁeld geom-
etry inside the core could be dominated by small length scales, yet only the weaker lower har-
monics of the ﬁeld would penetrate through a thermally stratiﬁed layer in the upper region of

the ﬂuid core and reach the surface. If so, the ﬁeld strength inside the core can exceed the sur-
face ﬁeld strength by a factor 1000. Taking a surface ﬁeld strength equal to ∼ 300 nT [e.g An-
derson et al., 2012], (cid:104)Br(cid:105) at the ICB could be as large as 0.3 mT, corresponding to approxi-
mately 10% of the ﬁeld strength within Earth’s core. Given that it is perhaps unlikely that Mer-
cury’s ﬁeld can be as high as that in Earth’s core, in all likelihood EM coupling at the ICB of
Mercury remains in the weak ﬁeld regime.

Figure 6 shows how ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns vary as functions of inner core radius for diﬀerent choices

of (cid:104)Br(cid:105). The larger (cid:104)Br(cid:105) is, the stronger is the EM coupling at the ICB, and the smaller is the
diﬀerential rotation between the ﬂuid core and inner core. The inner core and ﬂuid core are vir-
tually locked into a common precession motion when (cid:104)Br(cid:105) > 0.3 mT. Further increasing (cid:104)Br(cid:105)
above 1 mT does not change the solution as EM coupling already dominates all other torques
on the inner core. This is the case even when EM coupling transitions into the strong ﬁeld regime.
EM coupling at the CMB is included in these calculations, with σm = 1 S m−1 and (cid:12)
190 nT, but remains much weaker than the inertial torque at the CMB, so for a small inner core
we retrieved the solutions of ˜εm and ˜mf shown in Figure 4.

As the inner core radius is increased, both ˜εm and ˜mf get smaller, as it was the case with
viscous coupling alone, although the addition of EM coupling lead to more substantial changes.
The inner core needs to be larger than approximately 500 km for changes in the Cassini state
equilibrium to be noticeable. It is important to point out that ˜mf is reduced not because of
EM coupling at the CMB, but rather from the combination of EM coupling at the ICB, which
pulls the ﬂuid core towards an alignment with the inner core, and gravitational coupling on the
inner core, which pulls the latter to align with the mantle. The larger the EM coupling is, the
greater is the reduction in ˜εm and ˜mf .

When the EM coupling at the ICB is suﬃciently strong that the ﬂuid and solid cores are
locked into a common precession motion, a good approximation of ˜εm is given by the same pre-
diction as Equations (39-40) involving the eﬀective moment of inertia C (cid:48), except χ is now given
by

χ =

¯AcΩp cos I − ¯AsΩoα3φs
¯Af Ωo(ef + Kcmb) + ¯AsΩoesα3αg − ¯AcΩp cos I

.

(54)

For a small inner core, ¯AcΩp cos I > ¯AsΩoα3φs and χ is positive. Because ¯AsΩoα3φs increases
with inner core size, χ gets smaller, and so do C (cid:48) and ˜εm. The mantle obliquity drops from 2.049
arcmin for a small inner core to 2.034 arcmin for an inner core of 1500 km, a reduction of 0.015
arcmin. For an inner core larger than ≈ 1000 km, ¯AcΩp cos I < ¯AsΩoα3φs, so χ becomes neg-
ative, C (cid:48) becomes smaller than the moment of inertia of a rigid Mercury C, and ˜εm becomes
smaller than the prediction based on a rigid planet.

The larger the inner core is, the smaller are the misalignments of the ﬂuid and solid cores
with respect to the mantle. Hence, the general conclusion we reached for viscous coupling alone
is not altered with the addition of EM coupling but further strengthened; the larger the inner
core is, the closer we approach a planet precessing as a rigid body. This is best revealed by the
obliquity of the gravity ﬁeld ˜εg which, for a large inner core, asymptotically approaches the obliq-
uity expected for a rigid planet. Note that with strong EM coupling at the ICB, the oﬀset be-
tween ˜εm and ˜εg can be as large as 0.008 arcmin for a large inner core.

3.5 Fixed inner core density versus ﬁxed ICB density contrast

Coupling models when viscous and EM stresses are both present have been presented in

Mathews and Guo [2005] and Deleplace and Cardin [2006]. However, in the light of our results,

(colour in legend).

for the Cassini state equilibrium of Mercury, the tangential stress at the CMB is dominated by
viscous forces, and that at the ICB should be dominated by EM forces. To simplify, we con-
sider a model where Kcmb is purely from viscous coupling and Kicb purely from EM coupling.
We choose an eﬀective viscosity at the CMB of ν = 10−4 m2 s−1, which we believe to be a
representative value given the comparison with the Moon (see section 3.3). We take a radial
ﬁeld strength at the ICB of (cid:104)Br(cid:105) = 0.3 mT, approximately the ﬁeld strength expected under
the dynamo scenario of Christensen [2006]. We adopt these values as those of a ‘representa-
tive’ coupling model, although the uncertainty on ν and (cid:104)Br(cid:105) obviously remains high.

Figure 7 shows how ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns vary with inner core radius for the ’representative’
coupling model (black lines) under the ﬁxed inner core density scenario that we have used in
sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Figure 7 also shows how the results change when, for the same rep-
resentative coupling model, we adopt instead a ﬁxed density contrast between the ﬂuid and solid
cores and for diﬀerent choices of α3 (coloured lines). For a relatively high density contrast (α3 =
0.2), the results are qualitatively similar to the ﬁxed inner core density scenario. For a smaller
α3, the point at which the orientation of the co-precessing ﬂuid and inner cores begins to be
pulled into an alignment with the mantle is pushed to a larger inner core radius. However, the
general behaviour of ˜εm, ˜mf and ˜ns as functions of inner core radius is unchanged. Hence, all
our results in the previous three sections would be qualitatively similar under a ﬁxed density
contrast scenario. A smaller density contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core
is required in order to produce an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.

4 Discussion

The study of Peale et al. [2016] also presented predictions of the obliquities of the man-
tle, ﬂuid core and inner core associated with the equilibrium Cassini state of Mercury. Their
model included the tangential viscous stress at the ICB and CMB, but not the EM stress. Their
Table 1 gives the obliquities of the mantle, ﬂuid core and inner core, denoted respectively as

etary radius (≈ 1463 km, close to the maximum inner core size of 1500 km we have considered),

mately to the deviation of the obliquity with respect to that of a rigid planet.

s = ˜εm + ˜ns. To summarize

When only viscous stress is included in our model (section 3.3), our results are substan-
tially diﬀerent. As illustrated in Figure 4, we ﬁnd instead that the obliquity of the ﬂuid core
gets smaller with inner core size and that the change is very modest. In contrast with the re-
sults of Peale et al. [2016], we ﬁnd that the inner core obliquity is typically smaller than that
of the ﬂuid core, except when the inner core is very small or when the eﬀective viscosity is un-
reasonably large. We also ﬁnd that as the inner core size is increased, the mantle obliquity gets
smaller, opposite to the results of Peale et al. [2016], and that the changes remain small, at most
of the order of 0.005 arcmin. A part of the diﬀerence is due to the diﬀerent viscous coupling
model that we use. But even when we adopt their model parameters and use their viscosity model,
we were not able to reproduce their results.

In the absence of viscous and EM coupling, the strong gravitational torque exerted on the

inner core by the mantle should prevent any large misalignment between the two. This is cap-
tured by the period of the FICN, which is of the order of 100 yr, much shorter than the forc-
ing period of 325 kyr. Viscous and/or EM coupling at the ICB can counteract the gravitational
torque (and alter the period of the FICN), but only for a small inner core. The ratio of the viscous-
EM torque to the gravitational torque decreases with inner core size, so a large inner core should
be more strongly aligned with the mantle. The more strongly the inner core and mantle are

gravitationally locked together, the more they behave as a single rigid body in response to the
external torque from the Sun. We expect then that the obliquity of the mantle should be brought
closer to that of a rigid planet when the inner core is larger. Hence, we ﬁnd puzzling the re-
sults of Peale et al. [2016], which suggest the opposite.

We showed that EM coupling is most likely larger than viscous coupling at the ICB, even
though our knowledge of the radial magnetic ﬁeld strength inside Mercury (on which EM cou-
pling depends) remains poor. If the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the ICB is above 0.3 mT, EM
coupling is suﬃciently strong to bring the ﬂuid and solid cores into a locked procession motion.
The larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core is forced into an alignment with
the mantle because of the mantle gravitational torque on the inner core. As a result, the larger
the inner core is, the closer we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as
a rigid body. The addition of EM coupling at the ICB does not change the overall picture that
we observe with viscous coupling alone; the mantle obliquity decreases with inner core size. The
amplitude of the decrease can be as large as 0.015 arcmin, 3 times larger than for viscous cou-
pling alone; this remains a factor 10 smaller than the changes suggested in Peale et al. [2016],
and again, importantly, in the reverse direction.

Our results suggest then that the presence and size of an inner core leads to only mod-
est changes of the mantle obliquity εm compared to the obliquity predicted on the basis of an
m). Let us denote this diﬀerence as ∆εm = εm−εr
entirely rigid planet (εr
m. The largest ∆εm
occurs for a small or no inner core, and is ∆εm ≈ 0.01 arcmin. This diﬀerence is decreased
as the inner core size is increased. For a suﬃciently large inner core, in the case of a strong EM
coupling and large density contrast at the ICB, ∆εm can be negative, but its absolute value
remains smaller than 0.01 arcmin.

To put these results in perspective, the uncertainty in the measurement of the mantle obliq-
uity reported by Margot et al. [2012] and Stark et al. [2015a] is of the order of 0.08 arcmin, much
larger than this diﬀerence. This means that, at the current level of precision, it is not possi-
ble to distinguish the position of the mantle obliquity from the obliquity of a rigid planet. This
is consistent with the fact that the observed obliquity falls close to that expected from a rigid
planet. But it also implies that the observed obliquity cannot be used to place constraints on
the inner core size.

Nevertheless, our results show that the presence of a ﬂuid core and inner core aﬀect the
resulting mantle obliquity by as much as 0.01 arcmin. This is of the same order as the change
in obliquity caused by elastic tidal deformation, which is of the order of 0.35 arcsec (≈ 0.006
arcmin) [Baland et al., 2017]. This is also of the same order as the amplitude of the nutation
motion about the mean equilibrium Cassini state forced by the precession of the pericenter, which
is approximately 0.85 arcsec (≈ 0.014 arcmin) [Baland et al., 2017]. The precision on the obliq-
uity from the upcoming BepiColombo satellite mission is expected to be ≤ 0.5 arcsec (≤ 0.008
arcmin) [Cical`o et al., 2016]. Thus, in addition to including tidal deformation and the preces-
sion of the pericenter, a Cassini state model that includes a ﬂuid and solid core will then be
necessary in order to properly tie Mercury’s obliquity to its interior structure. In turn, this opens
the possibility of further constraining the interior structure of Mercury on the basis of its obliq-
uity.

Obliquity measurements based on tracking topographic features reﬂect the orientation of
the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle (εm). Measurements based on tracking the gravity ﬁeld
of Mercury reﬂect instead the orientation of the principal moment of the whole planet (εg). These
two orientations do not coincide when an inner core is present and is misaligned from the man-
tle. Since gravitational coupling prevents a large inner core tilt with respect to the mantle, we

–28–

ﬁnd that the misalignment ∆εg = εg − εm is limited. The maximum oﬀset that we obtain
is approximately ∆εg ≈ 0.007 arcmin. This limited magnitude of oﬀset is important in the
light of the recent obliquity of the gravity ﬁeld estimated in Genova et al. [2019], εg = 1.968±
0.027 arcmin. This is substantially smaller than the two mesurements of the obliquity of the
spin-symmetry axis of the mantle: εm = 2.04 ± 0.08 arcmin [Margot et al., 2012] and εm =
2.029±0.085 arcmin [Stark et al., 2015a], although all three measurements remain consistent
with one another within their error estimates. In their interpretation, Genova et al. [2019] sug-
gest that the diﬀerent central value of the obliquity that they obtain (smaller by ∼ 0.07 ar-
cmin) is perhaps explained by an oﬀset ∆εg due to the presence of a (possibly large) solid in-
ner core. However, this is one order of magnitude larger than the maximum magnitude of ∆εg
that we predict. Moreover, we predict that the obliquity of the gravity ﬁeld should be larger
than that of the mantle spin axis, not smaller. Hence, at the present-day level of the precision
of the measurements, εg and εm should coincide, and their diﬀerence cannot be interpreted as
reﬂecting the misalignment between the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet and the
mantle spin axis.

Lastly, we have concentrated our eﬀorts on the mutual orientations of the diﬀerent spin
and symmetry axes in the Cassini plane. Dissipation at the CMB and ICB introduced by vis-
cous and EM coupling also lead to a displacement of these axes in the direction perpendicu-
lar to the Cassini plane [e.g Peale et al., 2014]. Indeed, the two measurements based on track-
ing surface topographic features from Margot et al. [2012] and Stark et al. [2015a] suggest that
the mantle spin axis lags behind the Cassini plane by approximately 2 arcsec (∼ 0.03 arcmin).
Although this oﬀset is smaller than the measurement errors, so that the observed obliquity is
still consistent with no deviation away from the Cassini plane, some amount of dissipation in-
variably takes place. These measurements give then a measure of the possible amplitude of the
dissipation. One source of dissipation is from anelastic tidal deformation [Baland et al., 2017],
but viscous and EM coupling at the boundaries of the ﬂuid core is another. Hence, the out-of-
plane component of the observed obliquity may further help to quantify and constrain the in-
terior coupling mechanisms. This will be the subject of a future study.

5 Conclusion

We have investigated how the presence of a ﬂuid core and solid inner core aﬀects the Cassini

state equilibrium of Mercury. Our general conclusion is that the coupling strength between Mer-
cury’s interior regions is suﬃciently strong that the obliquity of the mantle spin-symmetry axis
does not deviate from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin. This largest oﬀset oc-
curs for a small or no inner core. The larger the inner core is, the more it is forced into an align-
ment with the mantle because of the strong gravitational torque between the two, and the closer
we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as a rigid body. The misalign-
ment between the polar moment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size,
but is limited to approximately 0.007 arcmin. These conclusions apply irrespective of the core
composition and thus of the partitioning of light elements into the solid core; a smaller den-
sity contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core is required in order to produce
an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.

Our results imply that the obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar moment of iner-
tia (or, equivalently, the gravity ﬁeld) should coincide at the present-day level of measurement
errors. Moreover, neither of these can be distinguished from the obliquity predicted on the ba-
sis of a rigid planet. However, the smaller measurement errors expected from the upcoming Bepi-
Columbo satellite mission may permit this distinction, and thus provide further constraints on
Mercury’s interior structure.
