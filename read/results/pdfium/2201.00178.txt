ABSTRACT
The technique of normal-mode coupling is a powerful tool with which to seismically image non￾axisymmetric phenomena in the Sun. Here we apply mode coupling in the Cartesian approximation to
probe steady, near-surface flows in the Sun. Using Doppler cubes obtained from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we perform inversions on mode-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at supergranular length
scales (∼30 Mm) near the surface compare extremely well with those obtained using the Local Corre￾lation Tracking method. We find that the Pearson correlation coefficient is ≥ 0.9 for divergence flows,
while ≥ 0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Helioseismology is the study of the Sun’s internal structure and its properties, by means of interpreting its effect
on solar oscillations (see Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002, for a review). These are resonant normal modes of the Sun,
behaving as standing waves in a cavity bounded by the solar surface and a depth that depends on the wavenumber
of the oscillation. As these waves penetrate the interior, they register information of the properties and dynamics of
the solar interior and return to the surface, where they are observed. The internal structure of the Sun can then be
retrieved through meticulous inversions of these seismic measurements.
Several important flow systems on the Sun have been inferred using various global and local helioseismic methods.
Of those, the most notable global helioseismic results include inferences on the solar differential rotation, through
global mode frequency splitting (Thompson et al. 1996; Schou et al. 1998), and the resolving the neutrino problem
(Bahcall & Pinsonneault 1992). Notable local helioseismic results include imaging of the meridional flow (Giles et al.
1997; Gizon et al. 2020) through time-distance helioseismology (Duvall et al. 1993), and farside imaging of active
regions (Braun & Lindsey 2001) and their near side emergence (Birch et al. 2016), through helioseismic holography
(Lindsey & Braun 2000). The recent discovery of various inertial waves (Gizon et al. 2021), including the equatorial
Rossby wave (L¨optien et al. 2018), has been achieved through local helioseismic ring-diagram analysis (Hill 1988) and
the non-helioseismic local correlation tracking (LCT, November & Simon 1988) of granulation.
In recent years, the use of global mode-coupling helioseismology (Woodard 1989; Lavely & Ritzwoller 1992) has
received attention, with many studies seeking to validate and demonstrate the importance of such a technique for
investigating numerous solar phenomena. While the derivation of the mode-coupling technique is mathematically
challenging, the data analysis is simple and utilizes all the information registered by the mode. Thus far, global
mode-coupling has been validated through observations of the meridional flow (Vorontsov 2011; Woodard et al. 2013),
differential rotation (Schad & Roth 2020; Kashyap et al. 2021), global-scale convection (Woodard 2014, 2016; Hanasoge
et al. 2020; Mani & Hanasoge 2021) and Rossby modes (Hanasoge & Mandal 2019; Mandal & Hanasoge 2020; Mandal
et al. 2021). Local mode-coupling analysis in the Cartesian approximation, formulated by Woodard (2006), was
validated by Hanson et al. (2021) (hereafter H21) by examining the power-spectrum of supergranular waves and
comparing with previous time-distance studies (Langfellner et al. 2018).

Normal-mode coupling refers to the concept of expressing solar-oscillation eigenfunctions as a linear weighted combi￾nation of model-eigenfunctions (e.g., Model S Christensen-Dalsgaard 2021). The model eigenfunctions form a complete
and orthogonal basis. By design, the model Sun is spherically symmetric, adiabatic, free from rotation, magnetism and
flows. In this state, the oscillations are considered to be uncoupled. The weights needed to express the solar-oscillation
eigenfunctions would then encode all the perturbations that are absent in the model. The forward problem then
reduces to relating observed seismic measurements to the perturbations that we want to infer. The surface wavefield
cross-correlation is the primary measurement in the mode-coupling analysis and can be directly related to the weights
(Woodard 2016). As mode coupling is a Fourier domain technique, wavefields are cross-correlated at different spatial
and temporal frequencies, leaving us with measurements sensitive to different quantities of interest.
In this study, we extend the spectral analysis of H21 and develop the method to produce near-surface flow maps
at supergranulation length scales. A part of the formalism that was used to derive the forward model in H21 is
reworked, primarily to image steady flows. Measurements are then constructed, and inversions to infer divergence flow
and radial vorticity are described. We also demonstrate signal associated with supergranular flow in a radial-order
coupling (p2-p2), which was not shown in H21. This helps in localizing the measurement sensitivity to the surface.
We compare our results with flows obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking method on solar granules.
1.1. Forward problem
In favor of algebraic brevity, we only show crucial steps here and refer the interested reader to Appendix A for a
complete derivation of the forward problem. Working in the plane-parallel atmosphere (see also Woodard 2006), we
denote the horizontal unit vectors ex and ey in our local Cartesian domain as pointing towards west and north on the
solar surface, respectively, and ez points outwards. This approximation is valid when observing patches of the surface
that are small when compared to the solar radius. When imaging steady, near-surface flows in the neighbourhood
of the supergranular scale (∼ 30 Mm), we expect the measured spectral cross-correlation signal to peak around the
horizontal wavenumber qR ≈ 120 (Rincon & Rieutord 2018), where q = |q| = |(qx, qy)| is the vector horizontal
wavenumber of the flow. Accordingly, the goal is to relate measurements (linearly, to facilitate inversion) to the flow
perturbation described in a horizontal Fourier domain. Supergranular velocities are subsonic (300-400 m/s, see Rincon
& Rieutord 2018), permitting us to model the flow vector u = (ux, uy, uz) in the Cartesian domain like so (Unno et al.
1989; Woodard 2006)
u
σ = ∇×[∇×(P ez)] + ∇×(T ez), (1)
where P = P
σ
(x) and T = T
σ
(x) are poloidal and toroidal scalar functions, varying with position x and temporal
frequency σ. ∇ is the 3D gradient operator. While mode-coupling can easily be extended to study time-varying
perturbations (see Woodard 2016; Mani & Hanasoge 2020; Hanasoge et al. 2020; Mandal & Hanasoge 2020, for
example), here we only consider the frequency bin σ = 0, denoting the temporally averaged flow over the period
of analysis. We therefore suppress σ from all terms this point forward, remembering that temporal dynamics of
perturbations may also be studied using the same model outlined in the following paragraphs. Simplifying eq 1 using
vector calculus results in
u = −∇2Pez + ∇(∂zP) + ∇hT×ez, (2)
where ∇h refers to derivatives only in the horizontal direction. Mode-coupling helioseismology is performed in the
Fourier domain, and since we wish to image horizontal flows on a small patch of the surface, we describe the flow as a
function of horizontal wavenumber q and depth zez. Hence the poloidal and toroidal flows are described by Pq(z) and
Tq(z), respectively. Furthermore, we parametrize the flow along ez using basis functions f(z) (Chebyshev, B-spline,
etc). This is expressed as
P ≡ Pq(z) = X
j
fj (z) Pqj , T ≡ Tq(z) = X
j
fj (z) Tqj . (3)
The flow coefficients Pqj and Tqj , represented by the discrete indices q and j, become ideal candidates for inversions,
where the flow for each wavenumber q can be inverted for independently; parallelization in computation can thus be
exploited to expedite inversions. Note that Pqj = P

−qj
and Tqj = T

for the flow field to be real in the spatio￾temporal domain.

The weight factor Hω (see eq A8) is a function of frequency, capturing information about the extent of coupling between
the two modes [n, k] and [n
0
, k0
], where n and n
0 are the radial orders of the modes, and k = |k| and k
0 = |k
0
| = |k+q|.
The spectral profile of the mode (see eq A9) is approximated using a Lorentzian (Anderson et al. 1990). The more the
Lorentzians of the two modes overlap, the stronger the coupling. Finally, the real terms Cqj,k and Dqj,k are poloidal
and toroidal flow sensitivity kernels respectively, that allow us to relate the flows in question to the measurements
and are derived from the solar model see Appendix A. They possess the symmetry relation: Cqj,k = C−qj,−k and
Dqj,k = D−qj,−k (see eq A6). The kernels, as flows, are expressed on the basis fj (z).
1.2. Least-squares of cross-correlation
Even though φ

isolates the effect of flow perturbations at individual wavenumbers q, a more compact mea￾surement, known in mode-coupling literature as ’B-coefficients’, is much better designed for inversion as it reduces the

Multiplying eq 4 on both sides by Hω∗

forward problem (compare with eq 4)
Bk,q =
X
j
Cqj,kPqj + Dqj,kTqj . (6)
In eq 5, Woodard (2007) and H21 thus far only considered positive-frequency components in the summation over ω.
Here, we sum over both ±ω within a few mode linewidths Γ. Denoting the resonant frequency of a mode using ωnk,
|ω| ∈ 
ωnk − Γnk/2, ωnk + Γnk/2

or
|ω| ∈ 
ωn0k0 − Γn0k0/2, ωn0k0 + Γn0k0/2

. (7)
Summing over ±ω guarantees that the parity Bk,q = B∗
−k,−q
(see Appendix A for derivation) is obeyed, thereby
ensuring that the flow field on the right-hand-side of eq 6 is a real physical quantity in the spatio-temporal domain.
Taking the complex conjugate on both sides of eq 6 and considering the negative wavenumber components −q and
−k,

Substituting parity and symmetry relations for all terms in the above results in eq 6. As Bk,q is constructed by a
least-squares fitting, it is noteworthy that summing over −ω will also lead to improvement in its signal-to-noise as a
by-product.
1.3. Noise model
In the addition to the sensitivity kernels, a systematic background noise model is required to infer the flows from
the observed B-coefficients. For estimating the contribution from realization noise to the measurements, we make the
following assumptions (Gizon & Birch 2004): that the excitation of the wavefield is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian
random process and the wavefields are uncorrelated across wavenumber and frequency in the absence of perturbations.
Every independent realization of a mode can be understood as the output of a damped harmonic oscillator driven by a
random forcing function (see Duvall & Harvey 1986). Modes are thus generated with random phases and amplitudes
and with finite lifetimes. This stochasticity leads to realization noise in repeated measurements of mode parameters

regions of the same colours indicate 1-linewidth Γ about the mode frequency. The yellow shaded region indicates the range of
kR and ω/2π to which we have restricted ourselves in this analysis. Beyond kR of 2000, it is seen that the theoretical fitting
of mode frequencies start deviating from the observed dispersion relation for the f-mode.
such as its amplitude, frequency and linewidth, and consequently in Bk,q in our case. We use the same noise model
as in H21, which was motivated by the above discussion,
Gk,q ≡ h|Bk,q|
2
i, (9)
where, unlike H21, we again sum over ±ω. Gk,q is real, with the symmetry relation Gk,q = G−k,−q (see Appendix A
for explanation).
2. DATA ANALYSIS
In order to examine near surface flows we build a time-series cube of Doppler images that are obtained from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012). Each image
is Postel projected, with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.48Mm, sperated in time by 45 seconds, and is tracked
at the (Snodgrass 1984) rotation rate. Here, we select a patch that is 194.4 × 194.4 Mm2
in size, tracked for 24 hours
and crosses the disk-center in the middle of observation time on the 14 Novemeber 2017 (Carrington rotation number
2197, Carrington longitude 90◦
). This Dopplercube is considered as the physical wavefield φ(x, y;t). The Fourier-space
wavefield φ
ω
k
(and subsequently, the cross-correlation φ
ω∗
k φ
ω
k+q
) is obtained by computing the 3D spatial and temporal
Fourier transform of the Dopplercube.
The duration of the observed region is long enough to provide sufficient frequency bins with which to sum over in
Eq 6, while short enough that supergranules do not substantially evolve (lifetime is purported to be 1.6 days; Rincon
& Rieutord 2018) over this period. Our observation region is close to the disk center to also avoid any contamination
from center-to-limb systematics (Zhao et al. 2012; Langfellner et al. 2015).
Maximum signal can be extracted from the weighted summation of the cross correlations (eq 5) when the spectral
profiles of the two modes [n, k] and [n
0
, k0
] closely align in ω space. This implies that their mode frequencies should be
sufficiently close (|ωnk − ωn0k0 | ≤ δ, the separation parameter). Since Lorentzians decay rapidly, the summation over
±ω is significant only over a few linewidths (, the summation parameter; see eq 7). We have empirically found and
tabulated δ in Table 1 for the radial order couplings n-n
0 ∈ f-f, p1-p1, and p2-p2 (the signal strength depends only
weakly on ; we set it to 3 line widths).
Figure 1 shows that for any two adjacent ridges (adjacent n and n
0
), mode frequencies ωnk and ωn0k become spaced
farther apart with increasing wavenumber kR. It is also known that mode linewidth Γ grows with radial orders for
a given kR. Moreover, holding the spatial and temporal sampling rates constant, the spatial size and duration of
observation set the total number of modes within a range of kR (and ω/2π) that can be clearly observed, thereby
affecting the quality of the seismic measurements. Owing to these factors, to maximize signal-to-noise (by visually
inspecting the power-spectrum), the parameters describing the extent of coupling over different ranges of kR at fixed
radial order are different. In wavenumber, we restrict our analysis to within 200 ≤ kR ≤ 2000 and qR ≤ 300. Our
frequency range is confined to span the range over which acoustic modes are observed (2 ≤ ω/2π ≤ 5 in mHz).

3. INVERSION
The final step to producing near-surface flow maps in Cartesian mode-coupling is to invert the measurements
Bk,q from the linear relation in eq 6. We describe inversion using regularized-least-squares (RLS) method here and
leave Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA, Pijpers & Thompson 1994) for Appendix B. The methods
complement each other (see Sekii 1997), where RLS tries to minimize the misfit between data and model, whereas
SOLA gives better localization. For total number of modes M, RLS scales as MxJ where J is the number of basis
functions fj (z) (J  M; see eq 3 and section 3.1), whereas SOLA scales as M2
(see Appendix B). For M > 5000,
computation starts to quickly become expensive for SOLA.
Mode eigenfunctions peak near the surface, with higher radial orders possessing smaller peaks in the interior. While
f-f coupling alone has enough sensitivity to probe perturbations at supergranular scales close to surface, signal is
present even in p1-p1, and p2-p2 (see Figure 3), and possibly other higher order self- and cross-couplings. Since we are
interested in only surface flows, we leave higher order coupling to future work.
It bears mentioning that the slopes of the ridges in the kR-ν spectrum (Figure 1) increase with radial order. This
limits us to low-to-intermediate kR (< 1000) for these higher radial orders if we are to remain under the acoustic cut￾off frequency of 5.3mHz. It also becomes imperative to use a spatially larger observation patch to gain access to signals
from low kR - too large an observation region could possibly render invalid the Cartesian geometry approximation.
Regardless, in addition to performing inversions using all the couplings stacked together, we also demonstrate inversions
separately for the three couplings (see Table 2) in order to account for the full gamut of mode-coupling as a signal-rich
helioseismic technique.
3.1. RLS
For given q, the forward problem may be stated as
KU = B, (10)
with the aim to minimize the misfit P
k
||KU − B||2, with || ||2 denoting the L2 norm. Here, K is the matrix formed
by the sensitivity kernels: {Cqj,k, Dqj,k}. U is a vector composed of the flow coefficients: {Pqj , Tqj} and B is a vector
composed of computed B-coefficients: {Bk,q}. The least-squares problem is solved simultaneously for poloidal and
toroidal flow. We use B-spline basis functions as our fj (z), comprising 11 knots spaced uniformly in acoustic radius,
for both poloidal and toroidal coefficients. Hence, for M modes (total number of k for a given q is M) and 11 basis
functions for each poloidal and toroidal, the dimensions of K, U and B are thus M ×22, 22×1, and M ×1 respectively.

diamond.
Since the least-squares problem is typically ill-posed, we restate the minimization as P
k
||KU − B||2 + λ||U||2 with
the regularization parameter λ which this results in a trade-off between misfit reduction (first term) and solution
norm minimization (second term). Under-regularizing can lead to a solution U that is dominated by errors in the
data and on the other hand, over-regularizing may smooth or damp the solution more than necessary. Including this
regularization makes the problem better conditioned and is now defined as
U = (K|Λ
−1K + λI)
−1K|Λ

where I is the identity matrix for L1 regularization. The knee-point of the L-curve (Hansen 1992), a curve formed
by plotting ||U||2 vs ||KU − B||2 for different values of λ (see right panel of Figure 2), is usually chosen as the
regularization parameter. After successfully inverting for U, we reconstruct the flow using eq 3. Results for poloidal
flow Pq are shown in Figure 3.
4. LCT
To improve confidence in the imaged near-surface flows through mode-coupling, we compare them with flows obtained
from Local Correlation Tracking method (LCT; November & Simon 1988). LCT provides surface-flow maps by
examining the advection of convective granules (1.2 Mm, qR ≈ 3500; Hathaway et al. 2015) by underlying larger￾scale flow systems. Since granules are used as tracers, which are much smaller in size than supergranules (≈ 35 Mm),
LCT is an effective method (see Rieutord et al. 2001) to produce surface horizontal flow maps of supergranulation.
Time series of intensity images from HMI, with the same properties of the Dopplercubes described in section 2
(tracking rate, date, location, size and duration of observed patch, spatial and temporal sampling rate), are ob￾tained and Postel projected. The horizontal flows are deduced by tracking the proper motions of granules between
consecutive intensity images, which we denote as I1, I2. The LCT method selects a patch in two images each
(I1 = I1e
(x−xij )
2/2 sigma2
, I2 = I2e
(x−xij )
2/2 sigma2
) that observe the same granule at the grid point xij = (xi
, yj ).
A Gaussian of width sigma allows to isolate a small region surrounding the grid point of interest as the distance
moved by granules are usually in sub-pixel regime. The convention for the direction of x is the same as described in
section 1.1. The two patches I1, I2 are then cross correlated for different values of position shifts ∆x,
Cij (∆x, ∆y) = Z
dx I
∗
1
(−x)I2(∆x − x). (14)
The shift ∆x = (∆x, ∆y) that maximizes the cross-correlation Cij is taken to be the proper motion of the granule.
Provided that the time difference ∆t, here 45 seconds, between the images is less than the lifetime of granules (< 10
min), the velocities are given by vx = ∆x/∆t and vy = ∆y/∆t. This exercise is repeated for all grid points in the
images I1, I2 and for each consecutive pair of images in the cube.
In practice, we use the Fourier LCT algorithm (FLCT, Fisher & Welsch 2008) for computing vx and vy. FLCT
requires the input sigma, which we set to 4 pix, that captures the extent of localization desired, and depends on the

FLCT code. vx and vy are then computed for consecutive pairs of images and are averaged over the entire day.
5. MAPS OF HORIZONTAL DIVERGENCE AND RADIAL VORTICITY
For mode-coupling, horizontal divergence (hereafter div) and radial vorticity (hereafter curl) are computed by
substituting P and T from eq 3 into eq 2 as below -
u(q, z) = −∇2Pez + ∇(∂zP) + ∇hT×ez,

and curl is given by,

We follow similar steps to those taken in Langfellner et al. (2015) for comparison of flow maps with LCT. The
essential step for comparison at different length scales is to bandpass filter the Fourier-space flow around the qR of
interest (see Figure 4), and subsequently convert it to real space.
We seek to show comparisons (see Figures 5, 6, and 7) for qR = 100, 150, 200 and 250. To sufficiently delineate
flows at these length scales, we apply a Gaussian filter (see Figure 4) to flows obtained from eqns 16 and 17. The
Gaussian is centered at the desired wavenumber with a half-width of 25. We then perform a 2D Fourier transform to
obtain a real-space steady-flow map.

, from eqn 16, obtained from inversion using all the couplings. The
power-spectrum is then filtered with a bandpass centered around qR = 150 (middle panel). The resulting spectra is shown in
the right panel. The units of |div|
2
are in s−2
. For illustration, we show the action of the filter on the power-spectrum |div|
2
since it is a real quantity, but recall that it is the Fourier-space flow div (a complex quantity) on which we apply the filter.
For LCT, we first apply a Gaussian smoothing to vx and vy to average over small-scale features; the extent of
smoothing depends on the length scale qR to be compared with mode-coupling. div and curl are then simply
computed by
div = ∂xvx + ∂yvy, (18)
curl = ∂xvy − ∂yvx. (19)
We then perform a 2D Fourier transform on eqns 18 and 19, apply the same Gaussian filters as for mode-coupling,
and transform back to real space.
Condensing all of the above, the following sequence of operations to compare flows at desired length scales are
performed for mode-coupling (M-C) and for LCT -

6. RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes the results of the comparison between flows obtained from mode-coupling and LCT. Figure 5,
where we have used all the couplings to perform inversions, shows a 97% correlation between divergence flows from
the two methods near supergranular scale (qR ≈ 100). Near-surface flows are imaged most faithfully when all the
couplings are used. Since vortical flows are imaged at a region near the equator, it is possible that the source of
vorticity is something other than Coriolis force. Nevertheless, there is also a very good agreement (87%) between
the vortical flows as inferred from the two methods, despite being an order of magnitude weaker than the divergence
flows (this is consistent with the results of Hathaway et al. 2015; Langfellner et al. 2015; Rincon et al. 2017). Due to
insufficient modes for the p2-p2 case (see Table 1), we are unable to infer vortical flows with conviction other than near
the supergranular scale, as can be seen from Table 2. Figure 6 also aligns with what we believe can be accomplished
through mode-coupling helioseismology - using f-f or p1-p1 alone to seismically infer near-surface divergence and vortical
flows at different scales (qR = 100, 150) can yield extremely good agreement with LCT. As the length scale of the
inferred flow moves further away from that of supergranules (Figure 7), the demand on signal-to-noise also increases.
An adequate number of modes (and coupling strength between higher radial-orders) thus becomes a necessity to
comment substantively on the flows at these scales.

for LCT (top row), and mode-coupling inversions through RLS using all the couplings (middle row), bandpass filtered around
qR = 100 (see Figure 4). Corresponding scatter plots and correlation coefficients are shown in the bottom row. We cut edges
out from the flow maps and compare a circular region of diameter ≈175 Mm. The slopes of the best-fit line through the scatter
plots are 0.51 for divergence and 0.01 for vorticity. The vorticity flow maps are saturated to show only 40% of the maximum
values.
For both LCT and mode-coupling divergence and vorticity maps, numerous factors, arising from the associated
numerous data processing steps, can influence the final inference of flow amplitudes, making it difficult to put forward
a precise statement on them. H21 reported a 60% greater amplitude for p1-p1 over f-f coupling (Figure 3 reflects a
similar conclusion), another element to consider when combining different radial orders. The choice of regularization
(see right panel of Figure 2) has the potential to affect the amplitudes of the inverted flows to some degree. Flow
amplitudes also vary with depth, implying that different radial orders and LCT will measure different flow averages.
This variability emerges as a natural consequence of any helioseismic inversion procedure necessitating the use of a
radial grid along which kernels and flows tend to be described.
Thus, the amplitudes of the mode-coupling flows (and the correlation coefficient) depend upon the following factors:
• Coupling(s) used,
• Regularization parameter in the inversion,
• Smoothing applied to LCT flows (indirectly; see below paragraph),
• The depth at which flows are inferred.
Here, we report in Table 2 only the maximum correlation found from among the points in the radial grid close
to the surface (within ±0.5 Mm from z=0). For a desired comparison length scale qR, we first fix the coupling(s)
and the regularization parameter to be used in the inversion. We then separately compute filtered divergence and

vorticity maps for LCT for different values of smoothing. These flow maps are then compared with those obtained
from inversions at all depths in the radial grid that are within 0.5 Mm from the surface. The highest correlation
(corresponding to the above depths and smoothing) is noted and comparison flow maps are plotted for the desired
qR.
It has been shown (see De Rosa & Toomre 2004; Langfellner et al. 2015) that line-of-sight velocity from Dopplergrams
and LCT agree closely in amplitudes. But, to recapitulate, a host of factors described above can skew the amplitudes
for divergence flows owing to the multi-step process involved in obtaining them. For example, there has been a history
(see, e.g., De Rosa et al. 2000; Sekii et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2007; Langfellner et al. 2018; B¨oning et al. 2020; Korda
& Svanda ˇ 2021) of using travel-time difference as only a proxy for horizontal divergence. However, Langfellner et al.

(2015), Birch et al. (2016) and Birch et al. (2019) use empirically determined conversion factors to align flow amplitudes
from travel-time measurements with those of LCT, while acknowledging that LCT underestimates magnitudes (see
Verma et al. 2013; L¨optien et al. 2016). Even for the case of supergranulation divergence maps obtained through
ring-diagram helioseismology, Greer et al. (2016) only report normalized amplitudes.
In this work, we have developed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mode-coupling can be used
with great confidence to investigate flows near the surface. Careful inversions of mode-coupling measurements, built
using a sufficiently large modeset that penetrates into the deeper layers of the convection zone, can also enable probing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of supergranules, part of future work. With enough modes to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes, we suggest that Cartesian mode-coupling can find local helioseismic
applications to investigate other depth- and time-varying features such as giant cell flows (see Hathaway et al. 2013;
Hanson et al. 2020), emerging active regions, meridional flows and Rossby waves.

Note the symmetry Cqj,k = C−qj,−k and Dqj,k = D−qj,−k. This coupling integral contributes to the cross-spectral
measurement between modes k and k + q From eq 8 of Woodard (2014), we write the first-order effect of flow on
wavefield cross-correlation as

We absorb the factor −2iω into the definition of H. Substitute eq A6 in right-hand-side of eq A7 to obtain eq 4.
The mode spectral profile R is a Lorentzian, given by

where ωnk is the resonant frequency of the mode, and γnk is the mode linewidth. Eq A9 can be derived by introducing
mode damping −iωγρ as an operator in the differential equation that governs undamped, driven oscillations (see eq
5 of Hanasoge et al. 2017), and then deriving the effects of first-order perturbations to the wavefield cross-correlation.
Also, the parity Hω

This forces N to be isotropic, i.e., to only depend on k, and not k. The sum over ω is within five linewidths of ωnk.
Note that Eq. A8 through A10 are modified from H21 to ensure parity and that flow maps are real.
The three equations A8 through A10, along with the symmetry relation for kernels, and summation over ±ω, serve
to establish the parity Bσ

B. SOLA INVERSIONS
Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA, Pijpers & Thompson 1994) aims to obtain a set of weight factors
P
for the mode q and depth zo, which we will call αk,zo. A linear weighted sum of the measurements Bk,q in the fashion
k
αk,zoBk,q allows for an average value of the flow Pq(z) to be estimated at the depth zo. To obtain the coefficients
αk,zo, it is assumed that a set of sensitivity kernels Kk,q(z) for the mode q can be summed up coherently to give an
’averaging kernel’ that is localized at the depth zo. Conventionally, a Gaussian centered at zo and a width ∆ is chosen
which the averaging kernel should resemble after performing inversion.
B.1. Kernels in the integral form
Since the kernels in eq A6 are manifest as coefficients on a basis fj (z), we first derive kernels that can be expressed
as a function of depth z (see Figure 8). It is convenient to derive in matrix form. Thus, with the following definitions:
P ≡ Pq(z), p ≡ Pqj , F ≡ fj (z), B ≡ Bk,q C ≡ Cqj,k and K ≡ Kk,q(z), we write (assume only poloidal flow for
simplicity, the same derivations hold true for toroidal flow as well)
P = F p (B11)
The size of P is thus the same as the length of the radial grid z.
Now, pre-multiply by F
T and integrate over z on both sides (drop the integral notation for compactness),
F
T P = (F
T F)p
p = (F
T F)
−1 F
T P (B12)
Now, substituting eq B12 into the forward problem eq 6,
B = Cp

= KP (B13)

T (z, zo) = 1

This can be achieved by solving the optimization problem
minimize X =

T (z, zo) − Θq(z, zo)
i2
, (B16)
where we introduce the averaging kernel for mode q thus
Θq(z, zo) = X
k
αk,zoKk,q(z). (B17)
As an aside, we note that averaging kernels can similarly be constructed for RLS (see section 3.1) using eqns 13
and B14.
14 Mani et al.
Figure 8. Left: Kernel Kk,q(z) (eq B14) shown vs depth z for the three radial order couplings f-f, p1-p1, and p2-p2. qR =
[−112, −45] and kR = [−853, −157] is chosen for all the radial order couplings for comparison. Right: Averaging kernel
(eq B17) using SOLA, for qR = [−112, −45] at depth z0 = −0.48 Mm, and the corresponding target Gaussian (eq B15).
Integral of the averaging kernel over z is 0.89.
Setting ∂X
∂α → 0 gives us the matrix problem to be solved
A{α} = v,
{α} =

where the square matrix A =

R
dz Kk,q(z)T (z, zo). Here, k
0
is just a dummy index for
denoting elements in the matrix A, (k
0
6= k+q). In the last line of eq B18, we introduce regularization using an Identity
matrix I, with the regularization parameter µ - purpose being the same as that described in section 3.1. Obtaining
α thus becomes a highly expensive computationally for very large number of modes (see section 3). Substitute α
obtained from eq B18 into last line of eq B13, and P
k
on both sides

Inversions can similarly be performed for multiple depths by choosing suitable widths for the target Gaussians. Di￾vergence flow can then be obtained from eq 16. Results are shown in Figures 9 and 10.
