ABSTRACT
Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are believed to be strongl y dark matter dominated and thus are considered perfect obje cts to study
dark matter distribution and test theories of structure for mation. They possess resolved, multiple stellar populatio ns that offer new
possibilities for modeling. A promising tool for the dynami cal modeling of these objects is the Schwarzschild orbit sup erposition
method. In this work we extend our previous implementation o f the scheme to include more than one population of stars and a more
general form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested the improved approach on a nearly spherical, gas-free galax y formed in
the cosmological context from the Illustris simulation. We modeled the binned velocity moments for stars split into two populations
by metallicity and demonstrate that in spite of larger sampl ing errors the increased number of constraints leads to sign ificantly tighter
confidence regions on the recovered density and velocity ani sotropy profiles. We then applied the method to the Fornax dSp h galaxy
with stars similarly divided into two populations. In compa rison with our earlier work, we find the anisotropy parameter to be slightly
increasing, rather than decreasing, with radius and more st rongly constrained. We are also able to infer anisotropy for each stellar
population separately and find them to be significantly di fferent.

1. Introduction
Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group (Mateo
1998; Tolstoy et al. 2009) are considered to be a perfect tool to
test our current theories of structure formation involving dark
matter in the context of near-field cosmology. The objects ar e
believed to be strongly dark matter dominated with mass-to- light
ratios even on the order of a few hundred solar units. Due to th eir
proximity they are also the only extragalactic systems wher e individual
 stars can be resolved and their velocities measure d offering
 the possibility to create interesting dynamical mod eling
techniques.
The first estimates of dark matter content in dSph galaxies
were based on a single measurement of the line-of-sight velo city
dispersion of the stars and the application of the virial the orem.
As the samples of the stars with kinematic measurements grew ,
it became possible to estimate the profile of the velocity dis persion
 and model it using the Jeans equation (Binney & Tremaine
2008). Since the stars in the galaxy can move on a variety
of orbits, from circular to radial, the degeneracy between t he
anisotropy of the orbits and the mass distribution is inhere nt in
this type of modeling. The reason for this lies in the fact tha t
different combinations of these quantities can reproduce the ve locity
 dispersion profile equally well.
A way to overcome this issue, at least partially, is to resort to
higher order line-of-sight velocity moments, such as the ku rtosis,
 and use the corresponding Jeans equations. Since the ku rtosis
 is more sensitive to the velocity anisotropy than to the m ass
distribution, useful constraints can be obtained on both. S till, the
method requires large kinematic samples to estimate the vel ocitymoments reliably and some assumption on the functional form
of the anisotropy (Łokas 2002; Łokas et al. 2005).
The Schwarzschild modeling technique (Schwarzschild
1979) offers a different approach to estimate the properties of
dSph galaxies without prior assumptions on the type of orbit s.
It relies on building a galaxy model out of a set of best-fittin g
orbits probed in the range of energy and angular momenta. In
this method, the anisotropy of the stellar orbits comes out a s a
result of the modeling in the same way as the density profile. A lthough
 it has been originally developed for large elliptica l galaxies
 (van der Marel et al. 1998; Valluri et al. 2004; Gebhardt e t al.
2015), it has recently been adopted for use on discrete data
characteristic of dSph galaxies and applied to a number of
dwarfs, including Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sex tans
(Jardel & Gebhardt 2008; Jardel et al. 2013; Breddels & Helmi
2013; Breddels et al. 2013; Kowalczyk et al. 2019).
Many dSph galaxies show signs of the presence of multiple
stellar populations resulting from a few star formation epi sodes
(Bellazzini et al. 2001; del Pino et al. 2015; Fabrizio et al. 2016;
Pace et al. 2020). This observation o ffers a way to improve the
modeling methods since, assuming dynamical equilibrium, a ll
populations are supposed to be influenced by the same underlying
 gravitational potential of the galaxy, but they have d ifferent
 distributions so more constraints can be imposed dur ing
the modeling. This approach was first used by Battaglia et al.
(2008) to model the mass distribution in the Sculptor dSph
galaxy. A few attempts have also been made to constrain the
inner slope of the dark matter profile in dSph galaxies using
this technique (Walker & Peñarrubia 2011; Amorisco & Evans
2012; Hayashi et al. 2018) in order to resolve the so-called c uspcore
 problem. It has been shown to be di fficult, however, due

to the nonsphericity of the dwarfs that introduces biases in such
measurements (Kowalczyk et al. 2013; Genina et al. 2018).
In our recent papers (Kowalczyk et al. 2017, 2018, 2019) we
developed the Schwarzschild technique in the form applicab le to
binned velocity moments of a single tracer and verified its ab ility
 to reproduce the mass distribution and velocity anisotr opy of
simulated galaxies. We have also studied biases resulting f rom
the nonsphericity of the modeled objects. Later, we applied the
method to model the kinematics of the Fornax dSph galaxy esti mating
 its mass and anisotropy profiles with unprecedented p recision.

In this paper we extend our Schwarzschild modeling technique
 to include multiple stellar populations with the aim t o
constrain the properties of dSph galaxies even more strongl y.
We test our approach on a realistic simulated galaxy formed i n
the cosmological context, originating from the Illustris p roject
(V ogelsberger et al. 2014a). Although no precise analogues of
dSph galaxies are available in this simulation because of th e resolution,
 we use a more massive galaxy but with properties oth erwise
 similar to dSphs. The reliability of the modeling doe s not
depend on the particular value of the mass so we believe these
tests to be viable. We do not attempt to constrain the inner da rk
matter density profile (which is poorly resolved anyway) but try
to put tighter limits on the estimates of the mass and anisotr opy
profiles. Finally, we apply the improved method to the availa ble
kinematic data for the distinct stellar populations of the F ornax
dSph.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present
the data for the simulated galaxy as well as their splitting i nto
stellar populations and mock observations along the main ax es.
Section 3 contains an overview of our modeling method, the ap plication
 of the method to all stars and to two populations, a nd
a comparison of the results obtained with these two approach es.
The results of the application of the method to the Fornax dSp h
galaxy are presented in Section 4. We discuss our findings and
summarize the paper in Section 5.
2. Mock data
2.1. Selection of the simulated galaxy
In order to test our modeling method on realistic simulated
data, we decided to use a galaxy from the Illustris project
(V ogelsberger et al. 2014a,b; Genel et al. 2014; Nelson et al .
2015), namely the Illustris-1 cosmological simulation. Th is simulation
 follows the formation and evolution of galaxies fro m the
early Universe to the present by solving gravity and hydrody namics,
 as well as modeling of star formation, galactic wind s,

magnetic fields, and the feedback from black holes. Although
dwarf galaxies that are of our interest here are not resolved in the
suite, this can be easily overcome with the appropriate choi ce of
the object and the treatment of data.
As the key properties of dSph galaxy equivalents we identified:
 the lack of gas, the lack of a black hole, a low spin,
the stellar mass much smaller than the dark matter mass and a
nearly spherical shape. The last condition was adopted in an attempt
 to avoid any strong bias introduced by the spherical mo deling
 of a nonspherical object. Moreover, we required the ga laxy
to possess a significant number of both stellar and dark matter
 particles (over 105), and a well resolved center. Due to the
large softening scale for dark matter particles in the simul ation
(ǫDM=1.42 kpc), we looked for an object in which even the
more concentrated stellar population (see Section 2.2) ext ended
over 43 kpc so that the region a ffected by the numerical artifacts
was enclosed within 2-3 innermost data bins (we used 20 linea rly
spaced spatial bins, see Section 3.1).

ments. We decided to use a galaxy labeled as subhalo 16960.
All the relevant properties of the galaxy are given in Table 1 ,
including numbers of particles and total masses for both com ponents,
 and details on the shape of the stellar component: the axis
ratios minor to major (shortest to longest) c/a, intermediate to
major b/a, and the triaxiality parameter T=(a2−b2)/(a2−c2).
We distinguish between the half-mass radius provided in the Illustris
 database and the half-number radius r1/2, which we usefor further calculations in this paper. The di fference between the
two comes from a small gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio
with the distance from the galactic center. Since in our appr oach
we treat stars as equal-mass particles and refer to number de nsities
 (multiplied by the mean mass of a stellar particle whe n
needed), the application of the half-number radius is more s elfconsistent.

blue). Thin vertical lines indicate r0(see text) and the outer boundary of the spectroscopic data.
2.2. Splitting the stars into populations
Our chosen galaxy shows a complex formation history undergoing
 multiple mergers which result in extended star format ion
with a few star formation bursts. The last wet merger, that is a
merger with an object containing gas, happens at 6.9 Gyr from
the beginning of the simulation, whereas the last dry merger (no
gas transfer) at 12.1 Gyr, giving the galaxy enough time to re gain
dynamical equilibrium. We present the star formation rate ( SFR)
as a function of time (the age of the Universe) in Fig. 1, where
these last mergers are indicated with black and gray vertica l arrows.
 In Fig. 2 we show the distribution of stars as a function of
their metallicity (in solar units) and the time of formation . In order
 to divide the stellar sample into two populations we cut i t in
half based on the metallicity index of each stellar particle . This
split is indicated in Fig. 2 with the vertical line. With sati sfying
accuracy it separates the stars born before and after 4 Gyr si nce
the start of the simulation, which corresponds to the format ion
time before and after the end of the second major star burst, a s
shown in Fig. 1. We refer to the metal-rich stars as populatio n I
and to the metal-poor as population II, following the common ly
used nomenclature in astronomy.
In Fig. 3 we present maps of the projected stellar mass density,
 line-of-sight velocity, and line-of-sight velocity dispersion
for both populations obtained by projecting the galaxy alon g its
principal axes. The orientation was determined from the ine rtia
 tensor calculated from all stars within the half-number radius
r1/2and therefore is the same in both panels. The two populations
 differ significantly in the spatial distribution and kinematics
 with the metal-rich (considered to be younger) populati on I
being more concentrated but having lower central velocity d ispersion.
 Both populations show a weak rotation signal at lar ge
distances from the center.

φ)/(2σ2
r), whereσiare velocity dispersions in spherical coordinates
 (Binney & Tremaine 2008), describes the orbital struc ture
of galaxies. It is one of the most important dynamical proper ties
of bound systems which cannot be inferred directly from observations
 and has to be recovered by dynamical modeling. Th e
profiles of the anisotropy parameter βas well as the radial σr
and tangentialσt=[(σ2
θ+σ2
φ)/2]1/2velocity dispersions for our
simulated galaxy are presented in the consecutive columns o fFig. 4. Throughout the paper we use red, orange, and blue colo rs
to indicate values calculated or recovered for all stars, po pulation
 I, and population II, respectively. The two rows of the fi gure
show the behavior of the parameters at di fferent scales. The top
row plots the profiles with the distance from the center of the
galaxy in the logarithmic scale and shows the drop of anisotr opy
at the outer edges of the object. The bottom row uses the linea r
distance scale and focuses on the main body of the galaxy.
Figure 5 shows the surface number density profiles of the
stars as measured in di fferent directions. We can see that while
the different subsamples have quite distinguishable profiles, the
difference between the lines of sight is small because the galaxy
is close to spherical.
2.3. Observables
We generated nine sets of mock data by observing all stars and
each population separately along the principal axes determ ined
from all stars. For the observables to be used in the modeling we
divided the stars into 20 bins spaced linearly in distance fr om
the center of the galaxy up to 50 kpc, measuring the fraction
of the total number of stars and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th proper
moments of the line-of-sight velocity defined in Eq. 8 and 9
of Kowalczyk et al. (2018). The profiles of these quantities a re
shown in consecutive rows in Fig. 6. Columns correspond to di fferent
 lines of sight, from the left to the right: along the ma jor,
intermediate, and minor axis of the galaxy. For clarity of th e figure,
 in each panel we indicate only the error bars for one of th e
data sets. However, as the number of stars in a sample remains
roughly constant between the lines of sight, the error bars a re

the Schwarzschild modeling and its applications to real dat a

 profile of the tracer with the Sérsic formula, we found th at it

 galaxy considered here. We therefore fit the projected density
 profile with the King formula (King 1962)

have assumed log r0=0.33 which corresponds to three softening
scales for stellar particles in the Illustris simulation.
We probed the parameter a∈[0 : 1.3] with a step∆a=0.04
andc∈[1.1 : 2.9] with a step∆c=0.2, imposing the requirement
 on the total density profile to be monotonically decreas ing
with radius. For each set of parameters and for each line of si ght
we generated 1200 orbits using 100 values of energy (express ed
with the radius of a circular orbit) spaced logarithmically and
12 values of the relative angular momentum spaced linearly. The
outer radius of the orbit library, that is the apocenter of th e most
extended orbit, was set to rout=165 kpc in order to cover over
0.999 of the total stellar mass based on the fitted King profile
parameters.
We fit the kinematics weighted with the fraction of mass with
the constrained least squares algorithm where di fferent values
ofΥ0were obtained with a simple transformation of velocities
given by Eq. 12, 13, and 15 in Kowalczyk et al. (2018). In order
 to smooth out the numerical artifacts, the three-dimens ional
χ2spaces were then interpolated with 12-order polynomials(∼a4c4Υ4
0) that were further used to determine the global minimums
 (identified as the best-fitting models) and 1, 2, 3 σconfidence
 levels which for three parameters correspond to ∆χ2=
3.53,8.02,14.2 (Press et al. 1992).

and right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 for the results obtained for
all stars and the populations, respectively. We further cal culate
the total density (second rows) and the total mass content (t hird
rows). We include the obtained orbit anisotropy within the m odeled
 range in the bottom rows. The consecutive columns prese nt

and minor axis. Green lines indicate values for the best-fit m odels
 whereas the colored areas of decreasing intensity corre spond
to 1, 2, and 3σconfidence regions obtained as extreme values allowed
 by the models with χ2within a given region. In each panel
the true values from the simulation are presented with black lines
while thin vertical lines mark the values of r0and the outer range
of the data sets beyond which the reliability of results drop s significantly.
 The true mass-to-light ratio profile was obtaine d by
dividing the total mass by the fitted King profiles, therefore the
drop at 100 kpc is the numerical artifact occurring at the ver y
outskirts of the galaxy.
Whereas in the right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 the resulting
anisotropy is obtained from the fit of all stars and uses only t he
location of global minimum and confidence levels from two pop ulations
 (as in the top right panel of Fig. 7), in Fig. 9 we pres ent
another method of calculating the anisotropy. In the second and
third row we show the derived profiles for population I and II
separately and combine them as stellar mass weighted averag e
in the top row. As in previous figures, three columns refer to t he
different lines of sight whereas the narrow fourth one shows the
behavior of the true profiles outside the modeled range which , as
we noticed in our previous studies, in a limited way influence s
the results. Such an impact is understandable since the star s at
larger distances from the center are still included in the li ne-ofsight
 measurements.3.3. Comparison of fitting results
The main strength of the two populations method comes from
tracing the underlying gravitational potential at di fferent scales.
As can be seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 7, population I, whi ch
is more concentrated, is also more sensitive to Υ0, but gives
weaker constraints on aorc. On the other hand, population II
attempts to reproduce the total mass content at larger dista nces
as well, therefore showing stronger coupling between the pa rameters.

The global minimums of the χ2distributions for both approaches,
 that is modeling one and two populations, which we
identify as the best-fitting models, closely coincide showi ng that
there is no internal bias in the improved method. However, si gnificant
 differences can be observed when comparing the confidence
 levels, mainly at 1 and 3 σ. Namely, we find that using
two populations, the constraints we obtain on the density an d
anisotropy profile are much stronger.
Additionally, the more accurate method allows us to study
other effects and biases, for example the consequences of the
nonsphericity of the modeled object. Whereas for the fit of al l
stars the true values of the density, mass, and anisotropy pr ofiles
are contained within 1 σconfidence regions, the results for the
populations are more or less biased depending on the axis. Th ey
are well reproduced for the observation along the intermedi ate
axis, for which the e ffects of nonsphericity seem to cancel out,
and more biased for the remaining lines of sight. We notice a
trend from under- to overestimation of the anisotropy when g oing
 from the major to the minor axis.

4. Modeling Fornax dSph
In this section we present the application of our Schwarzsch ild
modeling scheme to the observational data for the Fornax dSp h
galaxy obtained by del Pino et al. (2015) and del Pino et al.
(2017). This study is a follow-up of the work of Kowalczyk et a l.
(2019) and can be directly compared to the results presented
there. Moreover, we refer the reader to these previous publi cations
 for details on the origin of data and our procedures use d
for cleaning the spectroscopic sample.
Similarly to the approach introduced in Section 2.2, we divided
 all available stars into two equal-size populations b ased on
their metallicity and then cross-correlated the samples wi th the
data used in Kowalczyk et al. (2019). The metallicity histog ram
of the final spectroscopic sample is shown in Fig. 10. Additio nally,
 we color-coded each bin with the population it has been
assigned to, namely orange or blue for population I or II. Int erestingly,
 the case of Fornax is similar to our simulated gala xy
as the split at [Fe/H]=−1 also captures an important feature
of the object’s star formation history, separating stars in to subsamples
 older and younger than 6 Gyr, as shown in Fig. 12 of
del Pino et al. (2015) and Fig. 8 of del Pino et al. (2017). The
numbers of stars contained in the samples of all stars, popul ation
 I, and population II are given in Table 2, where the indic es
"phot" and "spec" refer to the photometric and kinematic sam ples.
 The sum of stars in the populations is lower than in thesample of all stars since only stars with reliable measureme nts
of metallicity could be included.

The parameter space for Υ(r) has been probed as follows:
a∈[0 : 1.85] with a step∆a=0.05 and c∈[1.2 : 6] with a
step∆c=0.2. We point out that in Kowalczyk et al. (2019) the
parameter cwas fixed at c=3 and now we fit it as a free parameter.
 As for the mock data in Section 3.2, di fferent values of
Υ0were obtained with the transformation of velocity moments
within theχ2fitting routine. The values of ∆χ2for all stars and
the populations are shown in the two panels of Fig. 13 (left an d
right-hand side, respectively). Due to the dense coverage o f the
grid, we decided to include only the values within 3 σfrom the
fitted minimums (see Section 3.1).

mass, and velocity anisotropy resulting from the χ2distributions

(Kowalczyk et al. 2019), we obtained higher estimates of the enclosed

Interestingly, despite the significant shift of the positio n of
χ2
min(toc=4.2 for all stars and 3.6 for populations), the obtained
 profile of the anisotropy parameter remains decreasi ng or
flat for all stars but changes to increasing from 0 to 0.5 for th e
populations. Nevertheless, even in the latter case the prev ious
result agrees with the new finding within 1 σ.
The detailed analysis of the anisotropy is shown in Fig. 15
where the middle and bottom panels present the profiles obtained
 for each population separately. We notice that the pr ofile
for population I is decreasing or has a local minimum whereas
for population II is increasing (from −0.25 to 0.5 for the bestfitting
 model). Since population I is more concentrated, the last
bins contain very few stars, which limits their credibility . The
top panel of Fig. 15 presents the anisotropy of all stars calc ulated
 as a weighted superposition of two populations. With s uch
approach we still obtain the increasing profile (from 0 to 0.5 ) but
the previous result agrees with it only within 2 σ.
Since Fornax dSph is significantly elongated with the projected
 ellipticity of ǫ=0.30±0.01 (Irwin & Hatzidimitriou
1995), we anticipate some bias in the obtained results cause d
by the spherically symmetric modeling. Kowalczyk et al. (20 18)
studied such bias in an axisymmetric simulated object quali tatively
 similar to Fornax and identified di fferences in the systematic
 errors depending on whether the galaxy was observed alo ng
its major or minor axis. Assuming that Fornax is observed alo ng
the line of sight in between these extremes, we expect the tot al
mass profile to be slightly overestimated and the anisotropy to be
underestimated, further strengthening the likelihood of t he real
anisotropy to be radial and its profile to be growing with radi us
with respect to the results of Kowalczyk et al. (2019).
Both constant (like for our population I) and growing (population
 II) anisotropy profiles can arise from biased modeli ngof the real growing profile by observing an object along the
minor and major axis, respectively. However, for the bias to
occur in two populations presented here, their inner orient ations
 would need to be opposite. Since such morphological fe atures
 are not supported by the photometric studies of Fornax
(del Pino et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019) which rather find a good
spatial alignment between the stellar populations, we conc lude
that the anisotropy profiles of the two populations modeled i n
this work are indeed significantly distinct.
Finally, it is worth noticing that the so-called mass-follo wslight
 model, that is the one following from the assumption th at
the total density traces the stellar distribution, is no lon ger supported
 by the fit of the populations. With our parametrizatio n,
the mass-follows-light model corresponds to a=0 and whereas
it is enclosed within 3 σfor the fit of all stars, as was the case
in Kowalczyk et al. (2019), the allowed values for the improv ed
method are much larger, as demonstrated by the right panel of
Fig. 13.
5. Summary and discussion
Building on the previously created implementation of the
Schwarzschild orbit superposition method focused on model ing
dSph galaxies of the Local Group (Kowalczyk et al. 2017, 2018 ,
2019), we improved our tool by introducing multiple stellar populations.
 Such an improvement is desirable and justified sin ce
many of the dwarfs show signs of multiple star formation burs ts
or extended star formation episodes. As the di fferent populations
trace the common underlying gravitational potential, one m ay
expect a significant improvement in the estimates of not only the
total mass content but also the orbit anisotropy since this r obust
modeling technique reproduces the anisotropy as a by-produ ct
of the modeling rather than taking it as an assumption.
We have tested our hypothesis by modeling mock data generated
 from a galaxy formed in the Illustris simulation. Due to the
limitations of the resolution, we chose a galaxy of mass a few orders
 of magnitude larger than the estimated masses of classi cal
dwarfs. Still, the galaxy possessed appropriate qualitati ve characteristics,
 such as the lack of gas and an almost spherical s hape,

that made it a good test bed for modeling techniques applicable
 to dSph galaxies. We applied our approach to all data and
to two stellar populations separately, comparing the accur acy of
the obtained results. Although the addition of the second tr acer
seemingly increases the number of constraints twice, the in crement
 is somewhat compromised by the sampling errors since th e
number of stars in each sample is then reduced. Still, we foun d
strong improvements in the accuracy of the method when using
 two populations. The results of the modeling show that th e
density and velocity anisotropy profiles are more strongly c onstrained,
 most importantly at the 3 σlevel, that is the range of
allowed values is much narrower.
Similarly to the conclusions of Kowalczyk et al. (2018) who
explored the effects of nonsphericity using large and small
data samples, the comparison of results presented in the lef tand
 right-hand side panels of Fig. 8 suggests that the improv ed
method using two stellar populations gives more precise but less
accurate outcome. However, in both studies the apparent det erioration
 of the reliability is a consequence of modeling of a
nonspherical object. In both cases, a simpler approach (muc h
smaller data samples or using one stellar population) resul ted-2-101

in larger final uncertainties, usually containing the true v alues
within 1σconfidence region. On the other hand, the improved
methods exhibit substantially reduced uncertainties, hig hlighting
the underlying bias.
Our method parametrizes the total mass content with the
mass-to-light ratio varying with radius as a power-law in th e loglog
 scale. We made two main changes with respect to our previous
 work: we added a third parameter ccontrolling the steepness
of the mass-to-light ratio profile (previously fixed at the va lue of
3) and allowed for di fferent stellar density profiles (previously
only Sérsic, now also King). These changes are of course coupled
 since different density profiles require di fferent exponents to
reproduce the same mass profile. It is visible also in our resu lts
since the King profile applied in the simulated galaxy gave us
values of clower than 3. Nevertheless, we decided to use di fferent
 density profiles to make our method more general and appli cable
 to objects, such as our Illustris galaxy, for which the Sérsic
formula does not provide a good approximation of the density
distribution.
Finally, we applied the improved method to the data for the
Fornax dSph galaxy. Due to the addition of another free param eter
 in our functional form for the mass-to-light ratio, our results
 for modeling all stars are slightly di fferent from the ones
Article number, page 11 of 12
A&A proofs: manuscript no. Populations4
obtained in Kowalczyk et al. (2019). However, in terms of the
total density and mass distribution the estimates obtained here
agree very well with those earlier results in the range cover ed
by the data. Therefore, the detailed comparison with other e stimates
 from the literature presented in Kowalczyk et al. (201 9) is
still valid and we do not repeat it here.
A more significant di fference with respect to these previous
estimates is seen in the results of modeling two populations in
Fornax. In this case we find the anisotropy to be slightly incr easing
 rather than decreasing with radius and, most importantl y, the
confidence regions for this parameter, as well as for the density,
 are much narrower. We were thus able to obtain tighter c onstraints
 on the properties of Fornax, which means that the im proved
 method is successful. For the first time, we were also a ble
to deduce the velocity anisotropy profiles for each of the pop ulations
 separately. We found that the more concentrated, meta l-rich
population I has a decreasing anisotropy profile while the mo re
extended, metal-poor population II has the anisotropy incr easing
with radius. This finding may partially explain the large spr ead
of the anisotropy values obtained in the literature and summ arized
 in Table 2 and 3 of Kowalczyk et al. (2019), which were
often based on modeling subsamples of our spectroscopic dat a
set.
For both studied objects we split the stars into two populations
 by dividing them in half based on their metallicity, Z(in
solar units), for the Illustris galaxy and [Fe /H] for Fornax. Such
a method is approximate but justified. Both galaxies have com plex
 star formation history with multiple star formation bu rsts, as
demonstrated by Fig. 1 in this work and Fig. 7 in del Pino et al.
(2013), producing multiple stellar populations which cann ot be
easily tracked as the metallicity is a good but not perfect pr oxy
for the stellar age. Moreover, the metallicity histograms f or both
objects are approximately unimodal not allowing for a conve nient
 separation. More refined methods of division have been
suggested in the literature, for example in the form of the li kelihood
 function based on the position, velocity, and metallic ity index
 (Walker & Peñarrubia 2011). However, the likelihood fun ction
 requires many assumptions which introduce additional uncertainties
 into the treatment of the data. On the other hand , our
approach ensures the maximization of each sample (and there fore
 minimization of sampling errors) while capturing the i mportant
 features of the star formation history.
Further improvements to the Schwarzschild modeling
method are certainly possible. One way to proceed would be to
include the modeling of the proper motions of the stars. For n ow,
measurements of transverse velocities are available only f or the
brightest stars in dSph galaxies, but even small samples of t his
type could provide further constraints on the models, as dem onstrated
 by Strigari et al. (2007) and Massari et al. (2020).
